The headache has been constant for nine days. It\nhas not responded to a long list of medications given at two\ndifferent outside hospitals for presumed migraine HA disorder.\nThe headache started rather suddenly nine days ago while he was\nat an OSH for cardiac and GI workup for chest/epigastric pain.\nThis workup (at ___) was negative for PE with negative D-dimer,\nnegative for acute MI with negative troponins -- although\npulmonary hypertension and LVH were evident on echo -- and\npositive for GERD / gastric erosions on EGD, treated \nsuccessfully\nby starting a PPI and metoclopromide. They were unable to\nalleviate his headache despite attempted Tx with BDZ, narcotics,\naspirin, Fioricet, toradol, DHE, Zofran, and Imitrex. He was\ndischarged to home with a prescription for zolmitriptan 1.25mg\nq2h PRN (in addition to the PPI and Reglan), which did not help,\nand he returned to another OSH ED (___) for treatment of the\nHA. They were unable to Dx or treat his HA effectively either. \nAt\nsome point, an MRI was attempted in an outside facility with an\nopen/large-bore MRI, but his body habitus (almost 500 lbs)\nprevented it.\n\nHis headache is throbbing and pounding in quality. The location\nof the headache was initially in his mid-forehead, but soon \nafter\nextended back through primarily the left side of his head (it\ndoes not extend as far as the right temple) and it extends back\nto his neck. He says at times it feels like someone is pouding\nhis spine with a hammer. There is definite photophobia and mild\nphonophobia and, interestingly, blurred vision which during the\nexamination below, the patient described as pulsatile. There has\nbeen some nausea, no vomiting, but this does not seem to bother\nhim as much as the pain, photophobia, and blurred vision. There\nis nothing that seems to make the HA go away, not even\ntemporarily. He is still able to sleep, and it does not seem to\nawaken him from sleep, but it is present whenever he is awake. \nIV\nopiate medication (Dilaudid 1mg) \"takes the edge off\" from ___\nto ___ without actually diminishing the throbbing sensation,\nphotophobia, and pulsatile blurred vision. Besides the visual\nsymptoms listed above, he does not endorse any associated\nNeurologic deficits or changes (see ROS below).\n\nHe said that before this 9-day headache, he can only recall one\nor two headaches over the past ___ years, and neither was\nanything near as severe as this. The only prolonged or severe\nheadache he had was around the age of ___, lasted several days,\ndidn't respond to OTC analgesics, and was a/w severe nausea and\nseveral episodes of vomiting before it stopped. Thus, he does\nhave a history suspicious for migraine headache disorder, even \nif\nit has not recurred in ___ years.\n\nROS:\nOn neuro ROS, the pt denies diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia,\nlightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies\ndifficulties producing or comprehending speech recently (says\ngenerically he has experienced episodes of word-finding\ndifficulty in the past, but does not know the contex). Denies\nfocal weakness, numbness, parasthesiae. No bowel or bladder\nincontinence or retention. Denies incoordination.\n\nOn general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or\nchills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies\ncough, shortness of breath.  Denies current chest pain or\ntightness, palpitations.  Denies vomiting, diarrhea, \nconstipation\nor abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or bladder habits. \nNo dysuria. Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.\n\n \nPast Medical History:\n1.

He had an LP which showed that \nhe did not have a meningitis. Unfortunately, an opening pressure \ncould not be obtained as an LP could not be done in the lateral \ndecubitus position because of technical reasons, and could not \nbe done in the interventional radiology fluoroscopy suite.  He \nhad a CT head with vessel imaging (CTA/CTV) which did not show \nany abnormalities or evidence of  venous sinus thrombosis.  He \nwas treated for presumed status migrainous with Medrol taper.  \nHe also received a Magnesium infusion. He initially improved, \nbut then had more severe headache as well as visual symptoms.  A \nfundoscopic examination was limited as he could not tolerate it, \nhowever there was no optic disk abnormalities seen.  An LP was \nattempted on the floor but was unsuccessful.  For technical \nreasons related to his body weight and size, the LP could not be \ndone in the interventional radiology suite with fluoroscopic \nguidance. Because we could not obtain an opening pressure and \nbecause symptoms did not completely improve and idiopathic \nintracranial hypertension could not be excluded, a decision was \nmade to initiate empiric treatment with Acetazolamide for \nincreased intracranial pressure (pseudotumor cerebri). \nCorresponding to this possibility was some blurring in the \ninferior nasal field of the left eye. His headache did improve \nafter starting this.  He was also given muscle relaxants to \ntreat a muscle spasm component to his pain, which was evident on \npalpation.\n\nHe was continued on all other home medications including his \nstanding oxycontin and prn oxycodone for chronic backpain.  His \nMetformin was held as he received contrast, but was reinitiated \nupon discharge.  Blood sugars were monitored and he was \nmaintained on a sliding insulin scale.  \n\nWe recommend limiting analgesics, avoiding nicotine, and formal \nvisual field testing.  If headaches persist or worsen, chronic \npain medications such as Amitriptyline or Topamax could be \nconsidered.\n\nWe would also recommend that weight loss measures, including \npossible bariatric surgery, be expedited to minimize the risk of \npermanent visual compromise.  A letter was given to Mr. ___ to \nthis effect. \n \nMedications on Admission:\nMedications:\n1. Simvastatin 80mg qhs\n2. Zetia 10mg daily\n3. Lasix 80mg qweekly\n4.

You had a lumbar puncture in the emergency room \nand your spinal fluid was negative for meningitis. You had a \nhead CT scan with vessel imaging which did not show any clots.  \nYou were started on high dose oral steroids to treat presumed \n\"status migrainous\" which is a persistent migraine headache.  \nYou were also given a magnesium infusion to help improve your \nheadache. It also seems that you had a muscle spasm component to \nyour pain, which can be relieved with hot packs. \n\nBecause of your visual symptoms, and your risk of \"pseudotumor \ncerebri,\" you were started Acetazolamide for presumed increased \nintracranial pressure.  \n\nYou will require labs prior to your appointment in the Neurology \nClinic.  You will also need to see Ophthalmology for formal \nvisual field testing. This has been arranged for you.  If you \nwould like this to be done in ___, you can call your \nPCP to help you coordinate these tests.  \n\nWeight loss will be a very important component to help improve \nyour symptoms. We have provided you with a letter expressing our \nconcerns about this diagnosis to help have your bariatric \nsurgical evaluation expedited.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"

She \nunderwent 5 sessions of plasmapheresis. She was monitored on \ntelemetry throughout given her history of coronary vasospasm \nwith plasmapheresis. Her course was complicated by severe \nband-like lower abdominal pain following the first session, \nwhich was worked up extensively and found to be most likely \nrelated to transient vasospasm or fluid shifts after \nplasmapheresis, as well as an overly aggressive bowel regimen. \nPlasmapheresis was held for three days while her abdominal pain \nwas treated. With vigorous hydration prior to plasmapheresis as \nwell as supportive care with lorazepam for nausea, her abdominal \npain was better controlled. She then underwent the next four \nsessions of plasmapheresis. On the evening following removal of \nher pheresis line, she spiked a fever to 102, likely related to \ntransient bacteremia caused by line removal. Her line site \nappeared uninfected and infectious workup (blood cultures x2, \nurine culture, CXR) were normal. She remained afebrile for 24 \nhours following this. \n\nOn admission, patient's neuro exam was notable for atrophy in \nthe small muscles of the hands and feet bilaterally, symmetric \nweakness of the extensors of the upper extremities, diffuse \nareflexia, decreased sensation to light touch and pinprick L>R, \nand severely decreased vibration and proprioception in the feet \nand lower legs bilaterally, and pseudoathetosis of both feet, \nall consistent with known diagnosis of severe sensorimotor \npolyneuropathy.  On discharge her neuro exam had improved \nslightly in that joint position sense at the ankles was mildly \nimproved. Of note, it typically takes ___ weeks for patient to \nexperience benefits from plasmapheresis. \n\n# ID: On admission, patient complained of dysuria and was found \nto have a UTI (E. coli, sensitive to everything but TMP-SMX). \nShe was treated with a 5-day course of Ciprofloxacin and her \nsymptoms improved. \n\n=====================\nTRANSITIONS OF CARE: \n- Studies pending on discharge = blood cultures (___) \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

You received 5 sessions \nof plasmapheresis. You had several episodes of abdominal pain \nfollowing plasmapheresis which we believe may have been related \nto transient fluid shifts: this was helped with IV fluids. On \nthe day after your last session of plasmapheresis, you had a \nfever. The cause for this was not found but was likely caused by \nremoval of your plasmapheresis catheter causing brief \nintroduction of bacteria to your blood. You are being discharged \nto home with physical therapy, and will follow up with your \nneurologist and primary care doctor within the next couple of \ndays.  \n.\nPlease attend the follow-up appointment listed below with Dr. \n___ to follow up on your hospitalization. \n.\nWe did not make any changes to your home medications. Please \ncontinue to take them as you were prior to hospitalization. \n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"

The fluid from your abscess grew out bacteria including \nEscherichia coli, Shigella sonnei and Bacteroides fragilis.  You \nwere initially kept on the antibiotic, Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole \nand trimethoprim), to treat both the Shigella and E. coli.  You \nwere also started on another antibiotic, called Flagyl \n(metronidazole) to treat the Bacteroides.  A stool sample was \nsent while you were in the hospital which again showed shigella, \nbut the shigella was resistant to Bactrim.  Therefore, you were \nstarted on a new antibiotic, called Cefpodoxime to treat the \nshigella.   Your abdominal drain was ultimately removed and you \nwill continue on oral antibiotics for an additional 4 (four) \ndays.\n\nYou are now ready to be discharged home.  Please note the \nfollowing discharge instructions:\n\nPlease call your doctor or nurse practitioner or return to the \nEmergency Department for any of the following:\n\n*You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or \ntightness.\n*New or worsening cough, shortness of breath, or wheeze.\n*If you are vomiting and cannot keep down fluids or your \nmedications.\n*You are getting dehydrated due to continued vomiting, diarrhea, \nor other reasons.

The Infectious Disease thinks that the positive \nblood culture was not a true infection.\n\nIt is very important that you keep your follow-up appointment \nwith your primary care physician. She will recheck blood \ncultures at that visit.\n\nWe wish you the best!\n\nSincerely,\nYour ___ Team\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"

She \nwas transferred to the floor for evaluation and treatment.\n\n# Paroxysmal A.fib with RVR: She developed AFib with RVR which \nfailed to resolve with IV metoprolol 5mg x2 doses, IV metoprolol \n10mg x1 dose, and 10mg IV diltiaziam x1 dose, therefore she was \ntransferred to the TSICU for a diltiazem gtt. On hospital day 2 \nshe converted to sinus rhythm so the dilt gtt was stopped, she \nwas restarted on her home dose of metoprolol 50mg BID, and she \nwas transferred to the floor under the neurosurgery service. On \nhospital day 3, she again went into AFib with RVR. She received \n75mg PO metoprolol, 5mg IV metoprolol x3, and 15mg IV diltiazem \nand converted to SR. She was transferred to the cardiology \nservice for further management of her AFib. While on tele, the \npatient remained in sinus rhythm in the ___ and was discharged \nto rehab on her home dose of metoprolol 50mg BID. The patient \nreported that her cardiologist and her discussed anticoagulation \nand recommended that she be on aspirin 325 as opposed to \ncoumadin. With her paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, it should be \nconsidered if she would benefit from an anti-arrhthymic. \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n=====================\n# HTN: Has been well controlled this admission on her home \nmedications. No epsisodes of hypotension during afib with RVR.  \nShe was maintained on home valsartan, and HCTZ.\n \n#HLD: she was maintained home pravastatin.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n===========================\n# TSH pending at the time of discharge\n# With the patient's paroxysmal a.fib, she may benefit from \nchemical cardioversion\n# Anti-coagulation: would recommend re-considering starting \ncoumadin for anti-coagulation\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

You came to the hospital after you \nfell while preparing for your colonoscopy. Our imaging studies \nshowed that you had a fracture of your neck, more specifically \nthe vertebrae labeled, C2-C3 and upper back, the vertebrae \nlabeled T1-T2. \n\nWhile you were in the hospital, you intermittently had a fast \nirregular heart rate called atrial fibrillation. While you were \nhaving the a.fib, you did not have any symptoms of chest pain or \npalpitations. We did not change your medications for fear that \nyour heart rate would be too slow. From talking with you, you \nseemed to have talked with your cardiologists about coumadin to \nthin your blood because atrial fibrillation puts you at \nincreased risk for stroke. We continued you on aspirin 325.\n\nThe following are recommendations from the neurosurgeons who saw \nyou while in the hospital.\nDo not smoke.\nNo pulling up, lifting more than 10 lbs., or excessive bending \nor twisting.\nLimit your use of stairs to ___ times per day.\nYou are required to wear your cervical collar at all times.\nYou may shower briefly without the collar or back brace; \nunless you have been instructed otherwise.\nTake your pain medication as instructed; you may find it best \nif taken in the morning when you wake-up for morning stiffness, \nand before bed for sleeping discomfort.\nDo not take any anti-inflammatory medications such as Motrin, \nAdvil, Aspirin, and Ibuprofen etc. unless directed by your \ndoctor.\nIncrease your intake of fluids and fiber, as pain medicine \n(narcotics) can cause constipation. We recommend taking an over \nthe counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) while \ntaking narcotic pain medication.\nClearance to drive and return to work will be addressed at \nyour post-operative office visit.\n\nCALL YOUR SURGEON IMMEDIATELY IF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY OF THE \nFOLLOWING:\n\nPain that is continually increasing or not relieved by pain \nmedicine.\nAny weakness, numbness, tingling in your extremities.\nFever greater than or equal to 10.5° F. \nAny change in your bowel or bladder habits (such as loss of \nbowl or urine control). \n\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"

Lactate was normal. STAT CXR without \nfree air under diaphragm, but was not an upright film.  \nAbdominal pain still there but improved.  HCT stable at 31.9. \nRepeat CT abdomen showed slightly larger hematoma but no active \nextravasation and organizing components suggesting that her body \nis beginning to heal.  ACS is ok with her progress as long as \nHCT remains stable and has signed off. She was initially treated \nwith IV pain meds then switched to PO.  She should continue to \nhave serial abdominal exams at rehab and physician should be \nnotified if any acute changes in abdominal distention.\n\n# Anemia: HCT was stable ___ hours but decreased to 21.6.  She \nmay have continued bleeding from intraabdominal source. Patient \nmay have slow ooze from known hematoma.  She received 2UPRBC and \nHCT is slowly increasing, and was 34.2 on discharge.  \nReticulocyte count was 3.7 indicating appropriate BM response to \nanemia.  HCT should be monitored weekly while in rehab.\n\n# Hematuria: unclear etiology. Urology thought could be ___ to \npelvic hematoma and would presume that would resolve with \nresolution of clot.  However, may also be ___ to traumatic foley \ninsertion, but foley has been out for >48hr and hematuria \ncontinues.  Repeat u/a showed less RBCs which is promising.  CT \nabdomen showed mass effect on bladder, but her kidney function \ncontinues to be stable.  Urine cytology was negative for \nmalignancy.  She should f/u with urology upon discharge for \ncontinued monitoring.\n\n#LLE edema: Concerning for DVT, but ___ was negative.  \nPatient reports that this she has had ___ edema L>R for years, \nwill multiple u/s in the past that was negative.

WBC could \nbe ___ steroids, patient has been afebrile today.  If she \nbecomes febrile will need ___ vs. surgical drainage of hematoma \nfor culture. She remained afebrile with initially elevated WBC \nwhich could be attributed to systemic corticosteroids for COPD \nexacerbation.  She continued to be afebrile during her \nhospitalization and was not treated with Abx.\n\n# COPD: recent flare, on steroids for taper.  SOB may be \ncomplicated by increased abdominal pressure.  CXR was \nessentially unchanged from prior.

Uses a walker to ambulate and can walk 50 feet \nat once before stopping due to pain, but never gets exertional \nchest pain or shortness of breath. He smokes cigarettes and OMR \nnotes a history of COPD but he is unaware of this, and he is not \non any COPD meds. He has chronic ___ edema that is felt to be \nrelated to his vein grafts as well as kidney disease; he had a \nnormal ___ in ___ after his CABG. His edema is controlled with \nLasix and very occasional Metolazone. At an outpatient \nappontment with his PCP ___ ___ he was advised that he could use \nmore Metolazone, but he says that he has been using about the \nsame amount (Lasix 40mg daily and a Metolazone dose every week). \n \n.\nHe was at his baseline until ___ days ago when he started to \nfeel shortness of breath with exertion, feeling dyspneic when \nwalking around roms at home. The dyspnea worsened to the point \nof being present at rest. He denies any chest pain with these \nepisodes (he did have chest pain in the setting of his prior \nMI). Does get slightly lightheaded and sweaty with the shortness \nof breath. His leg swelling is at the same or better compared to \nbaseline. He has had a cough productive of frothy white sputum. \nNo fevers or chills. The shortness of breath seems to be worse \nwhen lying flat but he has no PND and no increase in the number \nof pillows he needed to breathe. No recent prolonged immobility \nor long travel. Due to the fact that his dyspnea worsened and \nwas present at rest he decided to go to the ED.  \n.\nIn the ED, he triggered on arrival for hypoxia to 88%RA. Initial \nVS were: 147/79, 83, 24, 88%RA but when rechecked was 92%RA and \nincreased to 95% on 2L NC. On exam, he was noted to have \nwheezing bilaterally. EKG was sinus rhythm with 1st degree AV \nblock (similar to prior) but with new TWI in II as well as \nV4-V6. Labs were notable for WBC 19 (80.7%N, no bands), Hct 38. \nBUN 53, Cr 2.2 (baseline is 1.4-1.6), Na 132. Lactate 1.9. Due \nto concern for CHF, BNP was checked and was 107. Troponin was \n0.03 so CK/MB were added on and were CK 397, MB 11. CXR showed \nno acute process. He continued to sound wheezy on exam so was \ntreated for COPD with Methylprednisolone 125mg IV, Azithromycin \n500mg PO, and Albuterol/Ipratropium nebs x2. For back pain he \nreceived Oxycodone 5mg-Acetaminophen 325mg. He was admitted to \nMedicine for presumed COPD. VS prior to transfer were: BP \n113/52, HR 88, RR 20, POx 93% 4L NC.  \n.\nOn arrival to the floor, he is comfortable and asks when he can \nbe discharged because his 70th birthday is in 2 days. Breathing \nfine. The nebs helped somewhat. No chest pain. He does not think \nthat he is urinating any less than usual, and his urine does not \nseem particularly dark these days. He is eating and drinking \nfine.  \n .\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  \nPertinent for mild constipation for which he takes some OTC \nsenna and Dulcolax. If his blood sugar gets low he gets \nlightheaded, wobbly on his feet, and develops blurry vision. He \nhas chronic lower back pain, knee and ankle pain. Baseline level \nof ankle edema currently. Right leg is always more swollen than \nthe left.  \nDenies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision changes, \nrhinorrhea, sore throat, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, \ndiarrhea, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.

The heart is normal size and \nthere is no vascular congestion or appreciable pleural effusion \nto point to cardiac decompensation.  There is no pneumothorax, \nvascular congestion, or pleural effusion. \n  \nIMPRESSION:  Probably pneumonia, due to aspiration or atypical \npathogen. \nPossible esophageal abnormality should be evaluated at least \nclinically, if not with a contrast swallow.   \natyp pna or aspiration  \n\nEKG ___\nNormal sinus rhythm. Voltage for left ventricular hypertrophy. \nNon-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing \nof ___ no significant change. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with CAD s/p AMI, HTN, DM2, \nCKD (baseline Cr 1.4), and tobacco use who presented to the ED \ndue to dyspnea.  He was found to have pneumonia and acute kidney \ninjury. His cardiac markers (enzymes, serial EKGs) were also \nfollowed to rule out an MI, and they were stable as well. On \ndischarge, he was instructed to hold his lisinopril, glyburide, \nand metolazone until PCP ___ due to ___. He was discharged \non levofloxacin on day 2 of his hospital course.\n.\n#. Dyspnea, hypoxia:  Mr. ___ presented with leukocytosis, \nshortness of breath, cough, hypoxia, and was found to have \nradiological evidence of basilar pneumoani. He was originally \ntreated for a COPD flare, in light of tobacco use and wheezing \non exam, but has no history of this, and pneumonia  was a more \nlikely cause of his symptoms. Urine legionella was negative. BNP \nwas less than 200, and he had a normal ___ in ___. Originally \ntreated with two days of a steroid burst course \n(methylprednosolone IV was transitioned to prednisone 60mg, \nwhich was stopped by ___. For treatment of pneumonia, he \nwas given one day of azithromycin, and was then started on \nlevofloxacin, which will end ___. He was also treated with \nipratropium nebulizer as well as albuterol inhaler, and given \nsupplemental O2 as tolerated to maintain oxygen saturation >90%. \nOn ambulation his SvO2 was >90.\n. \n#. ___ on CKD: Creatinine was 2.2 on admission, 1.8 on discharge \n(baseline Cr 1.4-1.6). Injury was likely prerenal in the setting \ndecreased intake and recent URI. Also recently uptitrated \ndiuretics for his lower extremity edema and volume depletion \ncould be secondary to this. Lisinopril, metolazone, furosemide \nwere held in the hospital. \n.\n#. CAD s/p MI: Mr. ___ had mild cardiac enzyme elevation, \nnonspecific EKG changes.  He does have a legitimate cardiac \nhistory but it is reassuring that he has no chest pain (pain was \npresent with his previous MI). Cardiac enzymes were negative, \ntelemetry was unrevealing, and EKGs showed nonspecific stable \nchanges. He was continued on ASA 325mg daily, as well as his \npravastatin and metoprolol.\n.\n#. ___ edema: chronic.  This has been attributed to prior vein \ngrafts as well as his CKD. Nothing to suggest CHF at this time, \nespecially with normal pump function on ___ ___ and BNP <200. \nLasix and Metolazone were held in the setting of ___.\n.\n#. HTN: Metoprolol was continued, lisinopril, metolazone, and \nlasix were held for ___. His hypertension was reasonably \nwell-controlled in the hospital.\n.\n#. DM2: HbA1c was 9.5 in ___.  Blood glucose was difficult to \ncontrol secondary to the steroids that were originally given for \nCOPD exacerbation. He was continued on his home dose of Humalin \n70/30 and covered with a Humalog insulin sliding scale. His \nglyburide was held during his hospital course. \n.\n#. HLD: stable.  Pravastatin continued in house.\n.\n#. Depression: stable. Citalopram continued in house.\n.\n#. Lower back pain: stable.  Controlled with Tylenol PRN and \nOxycodone PRN.\n.\n#. Glaucoma: stable.  Xalatan continued in-house.\n.\n#. Esophageal findings on CXR: The patient denies all symptoms \nrelating to esophagus. Further work up deferred to PCP.\n.\n# TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n- Metolazone, lisinopril, furosemide, and glyburide were held \nin-house. Pending renal function improvement, these may be \nre-started at ___ appointment per PCP's preference.\n- Please ensure adequate control of glucose as an outpatient \n(may be difficult due to initial steroid regimen). \n- Please ensure compliance with levofloxacin regimen (course \nends ___, and resolution of dyspnea. \n- Mr. ___ could benefit from smoking cessation, and seemed \nwilling to discuss this\n- He could benefit from referral for outpatient PFTs for \ninvestigation of COPD given his initial symptoms\n- Consider further evaluation of esophagus if symptoms develop\n \nMedications on Admission:\nPreadmission medications listed are correct and complete.  \nInformation was obtained from Patient.\n1.

Marked prevertebral soft tissue swelling is noted \nlikely secondary to postsurgical changes, and no loculated fluid \ncollection is seen. The visualized lung apices are clear. \nIMPRESSION:  \n1. Degenerative changes including posterior osteophytosis from \n___ cause severe central canal narrowing. Evaluation for \nintrathecal mass or infection is not well assessed on CT and can \nbe further evaluated with MRI.\n2.  Marked prevertebral soft tissue swelling is likely secondary \nto postsurgical changes, and no loculated fluid collection is \nseen. An MRI with contrast can be obtained if there is continued \nclinical concern for infection. \n\n___ (SINGLE VIEW)\nFINDINGS:\nThe patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Heart \nsize is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. \nNo pulmonary edema is demonstrated. Patchy opacities in the lung \nbases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No focal \nconsolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. \nCervical spinal fusion hardware is partially imaged. \nIMPRESSION: \nPatchy opacities in the lung bases, likely atelectasis.\n\n___ HEAD W/O CONTRAST\nFINDINGS: \nNo evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or acute large \nterritorial infarction.Mild prominence of the ventricles and \nsulci are consistent with ___ cortical volume loss.Faint \nperiventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensity is most \nlikely sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.\nThe basal cisterns are patent and there is preservation of \n___ matter differentiation.\nNo fracture identified. Mild mucosal thickening of the left \nsphenoid sinus. The visualized paranasal sinuses, mastoid air \ncells, and middle ear cavities are otherwise clear. The globes \nare unremarkable.\nIMPRESSION: \nChronic changes as described above. No intracranial hemorrhage. \nOf note MR is more sensitive in the detection of subtle \nabnormalities and infection.\n\nOTHER STUDIES\n=============\n___\nSinus rhythm. ___ interval prolongation. T wave flattening in \nleads I and aVL. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ \nthere is probably no significant change.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nSUMMARY: ___ with a complicated medical history including CAD \ns/p CABG, DM, COPD, CKD, CHF, and ?autoimmune disease recently \nunderwent cord decompression surgery on ___ and presented \nfrom home after a witnessed syncopal event, likely due to \nhypoglycemia from poor nutrition and fluid intake. The patient \nrequested to be discharged before a full work up could be \npursued.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES\n\n# Syncope\nThe etiology of the syncope was not certain, but the cause is \nlikely due to hypoglycemia. The patient recently had surgery and \nhas not been eating as well as he normally does (~25% of his \nnormal nutrition). However, he still takes the same amount of \ninsulin as he previously did, and he took 84 units of insulin \nglargine about 30 minutes prior to the episode. While glargine \nis not typically a peaking insulin, the large amount in \ncombination with 2 units of insulin lispro likely pushed him \ninto a range that is low for him. Previously, he has had similar \nhypoglycemic episodes with finger stick in the ___. No other \nobvious causes were identified. He did not have medication \nchanges. His chest ___ was unrevealing and UA was normal. \nThere were no symptoms or findings to suggest stroke or seizure. \nHis EKG was at baseline, and he had no biomarker increase. A ___ \nwas ordered for the patient. The patient was very adamant about \nbeing discharged on the day of admission, and he refused to \nstay. Given, his preferences, he was discharged with \ninstructions to reduce his insulin by 50% and follow up with PCP \nand ___ provider to adjust insulin to his dietary intake.\n\n# Bacteremia\nShortly before leaving, the microbiology lab reported a positive \nblood culture with gram positive cocci in clusters. Given his \nlack of symptoms and quick improvement and the patient's wishes \nto still be discharged, it was thought that the cultures were \nlikely contaminant and coagulase negative Staph. He was sent \nhome with instructions to return if blood cultures grow S. \naureus or if he develops a fever or feels unwell at all. He \nacknowledged understanding this plan.\n\nATTENDING ADDENDUM -- Cultures returned ___ coag negative staph \n-- no further workup needed (attributing this to contaminant).  \nThe resident team indicated they would notify the patient of \nthis result.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES\n\n# Cervical Myelopathy\nThe patient is  s/p ___ ACDF with Dr. ___ Orthopedic \n___. There were no concerning symptoms at this admission. \nFurther treatment and work up will be continued as outpatient.\n\n# Unresolved Leukocytosis\nPatient has had a long standing leukocytosis of unclear \netiology. It was presumed to be secondary to surgery or \ninfection on prior admissions. At this point, with no fevers or \nlocalizing symptoms, probability of infection was thought to be \nlow.\n\n# Diabetes\nHome insulin regimen was held with a modified sliding scale used \nwhile inpatient. Please see above for syncope. He was discharged \nwith instructions to take half (42U insulin glargine QPM) of his \nregular regimen (84U insulin glargine QPM).\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n- Lantus decreased to 42U daily, will need FSG trended at next \noutpt PCP appt\n- ___ must schedule outpt PCP appt in next 7 days\n- Pt should stop lisinopril dosing until his BP is ___ at \n___'s office as he didnt need it during hospitalization and may \nhave contributed to syncope\n- Pt would likely benefit from outpt ___ to ___ whether or \nnot he has CHF \n- Pt will need to be evaluated by primary care doctor prior to \nplanned surgical procedure next week to ensure that he is \nmedically stable.

As you know, you were admitted after passing out \nat home. Our workup was unrevealing as to what caused you to \npass out, but it seems that your low sugars may have been the \ncause. Since you are eating less after your surgery, your \ninsulin needs are much lower. Accordingly, you will need to \ndecrease your lantus dosing as we had discussed. It would have \nbeen preferable to test you on this new regimen during your \nhospitalization, but we understand that it is your wish to be \ndischarged home now that you are feeling better. We hope that \nyou continue to feel well. \n\nBelow are a summary of your medication changes:\n-Please decrease Lantus to 42 units\n-Please hold further lisinopril dosing until you are seen by \nyour primary care doctor \n \n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"

He was provided w/ appropriate outpatient orthopedic f/u \nappts. \n\nACUTE ISSUES:\n====================\n# S/P Cervical Laminectrony and fusion (___): \nPost-op, patient given 3 doses of IV clindamycin. Ortho \nrecommended soft C-collar to be worn at all times when out of \nbed. SQH and ASA were restarted on ___, and patient was \ntransitioned off IV Dilaudid PCA to standing tylenol + PRN \noxycodone. However, needed methylnaltrexone to stool. Patient \nseen by Physical Therapy, who recommended rehab based on \nimpaired ability to ambulate or transfer self.\n___ recs for nursing include: encourage frequent position changes \nand ambulation with S for hospital setting, and Assist of 2 for \nout of bed to chair with RW 3x/day.\nAt rehab, patient is to have daily dressing changes overlying \ncervical spine incision. Pt will have staples removed at Ortho \nf/u appt. \n\n# Leukocytosis (downtrending): WBC 18.8 initially post-op \n(nothing collected on admission) -> 17.8 -> 15.6; last WBC prior \nto admission was 16.3 (___). WBC initially elevated ___ \nlikely due to stress from surgery. Not on exogenous steroids. \nUrine culture from ___ negative. Prior records show most WBC \ncounts between ___ circumstances unclear. \n\n# Microscopic hematuria: seen ___ AM (>182 RBCs). UA from \n___ showed no RBCs and no blood (so no known hematuria at \nbaseline). Possibly due to Foley placement. Repeat urine from \n___ showed no gross hemauria, but UA still showed >182 RBCs. \nPlease repeat UA as outpatient in 7d to determine whether \nmicroscopic hematuria has resolved.\n\n# Hyponatremia: Na 134 -> 131 -> 132. Possibly due to SIADH from \npain. Continue to trend as outpatient to ensure trending up. \n\n# Diabetes\nPt was recently discharge ~1 month ago after pre-syncope/AMS \npresumed to be due to hypoglycemic episode. Since PO intake at \nthe time was low, home dose lantus and sliding scale was \ndecreased. On this admission, pt's PO intake increased \npost-operatively, as did his insulin requirements. Accordingly, \nHISS was uptitrated. He will need continued blood glucose \nmonitoring and likely uptitrating of his HISS.\n  \n#Anemia: Hct baseline ~34, Hct post-op 27.9 and has remained in \n___ range post-op. Likely ___ blood loss from OR. Please \ncontinue to trend Hct as outpatient.   \n\n#Hypertension: patient was continued on furosemide, metolazone, \nand metoprolol.

He was admitted to the ICU for \ntransient hypotension that resolved spontaneously. Blood and \nurine cultures and legionella urine antigen were all negative.  \nChest X-Ray was unremarkable. Chest CT was concerning for \npossible bronchopneumonia although appearance is atypical. It \ndid show innumerable centrilobular nodules measuring up to 5 mm \nthroughout both upper lungs. This is most likely infectious in \netiology.  \nOn presentation he had a new oxygen requirement but this was \nquickly weaned to room air without shortness of breath. He \nbecame afebrile with stable BP through out his stay. He was \nplaced on levofloxacin for five day course for fears of \ncommunity acquired pneumonia by the ICU team ( atypical and \nunlikely presentation. His blood and urine cultures are negative \nto date. His confusion/lethargy resolved prior to arrival to the \nemergency room.  He was noted to have elevated cardiac enzymes. \nHe has history of 95% LAD lesion treated with angioplasty in \n___.  EKG on admission with ST depressions but in the setting \nof tachycardia.  EKG changes resolved upon arrival to ICU.  CKs \nhave peaked and are tending down.  Troponin currently 0.25. \nThere was low suspicion that this represents acute plaque \nrupture given lack of symptoms but could represent demand \nischemia. He was treated with aspirin, atenolol, simvastatin.\nI have explained all of the above to the patient and his wife on \n2 separate occasions (yesterday and today). I advised him to \nremain in hospital to obtain TTE or TEE, chemical myocardial \nstress test, and CT of the abdomen ( adrenal enlargement on the \nCT of the chest). I explained that he probably had a \" minor \nheart attack\" that needs further testing and cardiology \nconsultation. He had unexplained fever, hypotension, confusion, \npulmonary nodules, and cardiac enzymes leak. He may need TEE to \nR/O cardiac source of infection. In addition, he needs stress \n___. In regards to the abnormal chest CT (multiple pulmonary \nnodules on chest CT).  No recent images for comparison. This \nneeds to be repeated after treatment with levofloxacin for \npresumed pneumonia ( can not R/O cardiac emboli, or old fungal \ninfection). He is a smoker with risk of lung malignancy. He also \nneed CT abdomen for the adrenal enlargement seen on CT chest. He \nneeds outpatient cardiac and pulmonary consultations.\nAgain, I expressed the need for longer hospital stay and further \ntesting. He decided to leave with his wife and get all above \ntests in the out patient setting.

Within these \nlimitations,\nthere is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or acute \nlarge vascular\nterritory infarction.  Ventricles and sulci are prominent, \nconsistent with\nage-related atrophy.  There is confluent periventricular white \nmatter\nhypodensity, consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic \ndisease.  The\nvisualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  \nThere is no\nfracture.\n \nIMPRESSION:\n1.  Limited study, but no acute intracranial process.\n2.  Age-related chronic small vessel ischemic disease.\n \n\nCXR\nFINDINGS:  The patient has had a prior left lower lobectomy.  \nSince the prior\nexam, nodular pleural thickening encasing the left lung has \nincreased at the\nexpense of aeration of the left lung with stable elevation of \nthe left\nhemidiaphragm. Central adenopathy in the left hilus and adjacent \nmediastinum\nhas also progressed. The right lung is clear.  Cardiomediastinal \nsilhouette is\nunchanged.\n \nIMPRESSION:  Progression of left pleural and nodal metastases.\n \n\nCT CHEST WITH CONTRAST\nFINDINGS:  As compared to the previous examination, the patient \nis after left\nupper lobectomy.  The previously collapsed left postoperative \nlung is now\nbetter ventilated.\n \nHowever, the left pleura is both focally and diffusely thickened \nand shows\nmultiple up to 2.5 cm large nodules.  These are most obvious in \nthe anterior\nand apical lung regions (3, 20) as well as in the inferior and \nposterior\nmedial lung regions (3, 30).  The left lung parenchyma also \nshows evidence of\nintraparenchymal nodules and one questionable endobronchial \nnodule at the\nlevel of the stump (4, 121).\n \nThe entire left hemithorax shows volume loss.  Small areas of \natelectasis are\nseen at the left lung bases.  In the right lung, there are \nmultiple soft\ntissue density nodules with maximum sizes of 5-6 mm.  All these \nnodules are\nlikely to reflect metastatic disease.  The nodules show a \nperipheral and lower\nlobe predominance.\n \nThere is no right pleural effusion.  Moderate pulmonary \nemphysema.\n \nUnchanged coronary calcifications, several lymph nodes, for \nexample in the\nprecarinal and the subcarinal area, are borderline in diameter.  \nModerate\naortic calcifications.\n \nNewly appeared is a 2.5 cm hypodense lesion at the level of the \nright adrenal\ngland, representing an adrenal metastasis.\n \nIMPRESSION:\n1.  Massive pleural metastatic disease in the left hemithorax, \nmultiple left\nintraparenchymal metastasis and one endobronchial metastasis.\n2.  Multiple right lung metastasis.\n3.  Newly appeared right adrenal metastasis.\n4.  Borderline mediastinal lymph nodes.\n5.  No evidence of osteolytic lesions.\n \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nACTIVE ISSUES\n\nDEMENTIA and FALLS:  Patient's mental status has been \ndeteriorating, leading to recurrent falls at home.  Per his wife \n___, Mr. ___ has often forgot where he is, the year/month, \nand his grandchildren.  He sleeps most of the day, and has been \nhaving falls at home.  On presentation to the hospital, patient \nsuffered a fall prior.  He was evaluated by physical therapy who \nrecommended home with physical therapy.\n\nSTAGE IV LUNG CANCER:  History of lower lobe resection for stage \nII cancer.  On presentation to the hospital, he had a chest xray \nthat was concerning for pleural involvement of malignancy.  \nFollow up CT chest with contrast confirmed diffuse metastatic \ndisease.  A family meeting was held with the patient's HCP \n___, oncology, and medicine.  At the conclusion of the \nmeeting, the decision was made to not pursue any palliative \ntreatment, and to allow the patient to go home with ___ services \nand eventual bridge to hospice care.\n\nCOPD and DYSPNEA:  Initially, ambulating with 83% sats on room \nair.  After several breathing treatments, saturations improved \nto 90% on RA with ambulation.  Patient's PCP currently working \non having home oxygen available for the patient.

No cholelithiasis or sonographic evidence of acute \ncholecystitis. No \nbiliary ductal dilation. \n  \n2. No renal masses, hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis. Increased \n\nechogenicity of the renal parenchyma bilaterally suggests \nunderlying medical renal disease. \n\nAbdominal DOPPER ___\nIMPRESSION: Patent renal veins bilaterally, without evidence of \nrenal vein \nthrombosis. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is a ___ year old woman with 6 days of N/V and poor PO \nintake who presented with a creatinine 12.8.  \n.  \n#. ARF: Patient initially described only 6 days of nausea and \nvomiting but in further discussion, she revealed that this has \nactually been going on for a month. She has not had any workup \nfor her nausea and vomiting. Her elevated Creatinine was likely \npre-renal, due to profound dyhydration. This is supported by the \nfact that her creatinine improved with IV fluids (from 12 on \nadmission to 1.9 on discharge.) She had not been urinating in \nthe ED but urinated well after several liters of IV fluid. Her \nurinalysis showed casts consistent with ATN, which was thought \nto be consistent with a long-term pre-renal ___ picture per \nrenal consult. CK was elevated and decreased overnight- this was \nalso thought to be consistent with dehydration. There was some \nconcern for renal vein thrombosis given patient's history of PE \nand that she presented with a subtherapeutic INR, but Doppler \nwas negative. Patient denies dysuria but given U/A showing neg \nleuks and nitrites with moderate bacteria, we discharged her on \na three day course of Cipro (she has had UTIs sensitive to this \nin the past.) On a telephone call after discharge, we advised \nthe patient to only take 5 mg Coumadin daily until she sees Dr. \n___ week (decreased from her normal schedule of 7.5 mg \non some days) due to the fact that she was taking Cipro.\n.  \n#. N/V: Patient did not have nausea or vomiting while in the \nhospital. This was thought to be due to viral gastroenteritis in \nthe short term. However, if she truly has had this problem for a \nmonth, she could have another underlying problem. She was told \nto follow this up with her PCP. The patient was able to tolerate \nfood and fluids in the hospital. She was told to contact her PCP \nor return to the ED if unable to tolerate POs. Of note the \npatient was afebrile, without diarrhea, with lipase 77.  \n.  \n#. h/o PE, subtherapeutic INR: Patient had been followed by heme \nand per history needs indefinite anticoagulation. She received a \ntherapeutic dose of lovenox in ED (120mg) while her Cr was 12.8 \nso we held anticoagulation in the hospital. A Factor XA test was \nperformed and was normal and so we decided to restart \nanti-coagulation on discharge. The patient did not need to be \nbridged because she didn't have an active clot (hx of clots over \na year ago per the patient) and so she was restarted on \ncoumadin. On a telephone call after discharge, we advised the \npatient to only take 5 mg Coumadin daily until she sees Dr. \n___ week (decreased from her normal schedule of 7.5 mg \non some days) due to the fact that she was taking Cipro.\n.   \n#. HTN: Patient was not hypertensive here. We held her \nlisinopril during hospitalization and on discharge with \ninstructions to follow this up with her PCP, given her acute \nkidney injury.  \n.  \n#. Psych: We held the patient's psych medication in the hospital \nbecause she ewas sedated from receiving them in the ED. We \nrestarted these on discharge.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nSeroquel 600 QHS  \nClonazepam 0.5mg daily  \nAlbuterol inhaler  \nLisinopril 20 mg daily  \nAmbien 12.5 CR daily  \nPercoset 2 tablets q4-6 prn  \nWarfarin 7.5mg MWF and 5 TuThSa  \nFlovent inhaler  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Cipro 250 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day for 3 \ndays.\nDisp:*6 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nHome\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\nPrimary Diagnosis:\nAcute Kidney Injury, likely due to dehydration\n.\nSecondary Diagnoses:\nGastroenteritis, likely viral\nHistory of PE, anti-coagulated\n\n \nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Clear and coherent.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.\n\n \nDischarge Instructions:\nYou were admitted to the hospital because you had nausea and \nvomiting. We were worried about your kidneys because our blood \ntests showed that they were not working well when you arrived. \nThis is likely because you were very dehydrated. We gave you a \nlot of IV fluids and your kidney blood tests improved. Because \nyour kidney is not completely back to normal, we think you \nshould stop taking Lisinopril for now. Your primary care doctor \ncan decide when to restart this. We were worried that you might \nhave a UTI so we are going to give you an antibiotic for this \nfor three days.\n.\nIt is very important that you take a lot of fluids at home; if \nyou are unable to hold these down, you should contact your PCP \nand come back to the ED immediately. You should tell your PCP \nabout your ongoing vomiting and she can decide how to work this \nup.\n.\nIn summary\nWe STOPPED your Lisinopril- you should talk to your PCP about \nwhen to restart this.\nWe ADDED Ciprofloxacin- you should take this for three days.\n.\nYou need to go get blood drawn on ___. These tests will be \nfaxed to your primary care doctor.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"

Normal-sized right ovary without an ovarian cyst or mass.  \nArterial and \nvenous waveforms were difficult to visualize, which is likely \ntechnical.  \nOvarian torsion or intermittent torsion cannot be completely \nexcluded on the \nbasis of this exam, although is thought to be less likely. \n2.  Nonvisualization of the left ovary. \n3.  Status post hysterectomy with a normal cervical remnant. \n.\n___ TTE:\nThe left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by \n2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is at \nleast 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and \nregional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >65%). The \nestimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue \nDoppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling \npressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free \nwall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear \nstructurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic \nstenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears \nstructurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The \nestimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is \nno pericardial effusion. \nIMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved \nglobal and regional biventricular systolic function. The aortic \narch is mildly dilated.\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nthe findings are similar.  \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ with PMH significant for DVT and PE x2 presented with recent \nepisode of chest pain and SOB, sub-therapeutic on coumadin due \nto h/o persistent N/V/D and inability to tolerate meds. \n. \n#Chest pain/SOB: The evening prior to admission, patient \nreported \"stabbing\" b/l pain that was pleuritic in nature, and \ncame on at rest, but eventually resolved on it's own. She was \nconcerned for recurrent PE, so she came to the ED the following \nday. CTA ruled out any embolus. EKG on admission unchanged from \nbaseline with lead II TWI. On the medical floor she had \nrecurrent \"sharp\" chest pain, and new EKG changes, with TWI in \nV2-V6. CE taken at time of pain were negative, as were CE the \nnight before. Evaluated by cardiology who did not believe pain \nto be cardiac in nature, as she has documented EKGs in the past \nwith a similiar pattern. TTE failed to reveal any wall motion \nabnormalities. Patient remained chest pain free for duration of \nhospitalization and was discharged home that evening. Most \nlikely cause of pain thought to be GERD. Will follow-up with \noutpatient physician to discuss ___ stress test.\n.\n#H/o PE:  Patient not taking coumadin prior to arrival due to \nN/V/D (see below), and as a result INR was sub-therapeutic at \n1.1. As she wsa high-risk for recurrent PE given multiple prior \nPEs, she was bridged with sub-cutaneous lovenox. Patient has \nscheduled follow-up at ___ for INR draw on \n___.\n.\n#N/V/D: Patient described 3 day h/o watery diarrhea, and \nnon-bilious, non-bloody emesis. This resolved 48 hours prior to \nthis presentation. She tolerated full meals while in-house. \nLikely due to viral gastroenteritis vs. partial SBO that had \nsince resolved based on CTA findings of bowel adhesion to \nanterior pelvic wall.\n.\n#Chronic pain: Chronic abdominal pain related to ?ovarian cyst. \nTVU revealed R. ovary w/?torsion. No severe pain on physical \nexam that would be consistent with torsion.  Continued on \noxycodone until seen by ob-gyn next week.\n.\n#HTN: Continued lisinopril\n.\n#Depression/anxiety: Continued wellbutrin, lorazepam, and \nseroquel\n.\nTransitional Issues;\n#Will need INR checked on ___ and lovenox d/c'ed when \ncoumadin therapeutic\n \nMedications on Admission:\n1.

CT \nperfusion imaging notable for relative decrease in right-sided \nperfusion, which, along with right gaze preference and \nresolution of symptoms, suggest left-sided seizure. EEG \nmonitoring did not demonstrate further concerning epileptiform \ndischarges or seizures during the admission.\n\nInitial laboratory evaluation notable for hypoglycemia, likely \nprecipitating the initial seizure event. Laboratory testing \nconsistent with SIADH, with CT chest not demonstrating evidence \nof underlying malignancy. Review of medications notable for \nrecent initiation of sertraline; per Nephrology evaluation, \nSSRIs have been associated with SIADH. Sertraline discontinued, \nand sodium corrected initially with hypertonic saline and \nsubsequently with free water restriction.

Although there was \ninitial concern that you may have had a stroke, no stroke was \nidentified with CT and MR images of your brain, and your \nsymptoms improved over the course of your stay. Instead, you \nwere found to have very low sodium levels at the time of your \ntransfer, which may have been caused by one of your recent \nmedications (sertraline); these low sodium levels likely led to \na seizure that caused your symptoms.\n\nDuring your stay, you were also seen by the Nephrology service, \nwho also felt that your low sodium was likely related to your \nmedications; you were treated with concentrated saline solution \nand restriction of your free water intake, after which your \nsodium levels improved. You did not have further seizures during \nyour stay.\n\nYou should avoid taking sertraline as a result of your reaction \nto this medication. You may resume taking your other usual \nmedications.\n\nPlease follow up with your primary care provider ___ ___ \nweeks of discharge.

No acute intra-abdominal or intra-pelvic process.  No \nevidence of small bowel obstruction. \n3.  Mild cecal mucosal thickening may represent colitis. \n\n___ MRCP:\nDilation of the main pancreatic duct and biliary tree to the \nampulla without underlying mass identified.

Ddx includes choledocolithiasis, \nbiliary sludge, sphincter of oddi spasm, pancreatic tumor, \nalthough no evidence of obstructing mass or stone on imaging. No \nelevation in liver function tests. ERCP was consulted and felt \nthat an endoscopic ultrasound would not be feasible given the \npatient's anatomy after her gastric bypass surgery. They \nrecommended that she follow up with them as an outpatient for \npossible ERCP for further workup. We tried to get in touch with \nthe patient's former gastroenterologist at ___ but were \nunsucessful.

The bony structures are \nintact.\nIMPRESSION:  No acute findings.\n.\nSMALL BOWEL FOLLOW THROUGH\nFINDINGS:\n \nUpon review of prior CT abdomen/pelvis, it was determined that \nthe patient is\nstatus post gastric bypass with complete reversal of the bypass. \n The stomach\nappears slightly deformed with thickened and edematous gastric \nfolds, likely\nsecondary to surgical changes.  Thin barium passes appropriately \nthrough the\ndistal antrum into the duodenum, and then into the jejunum.  \nThere is no\ncontrast filling of the Roux limb, which presumably was closed \nor excised. \nThere is no extravasation of contrast to suggest fistula or \nleak.  Small-bowel\nfollow-through was limited due to patient fatigue and inability \nto tolerate\nswallowing much barium.  Considerable portions of the distal \nsmall bowel are\nonly minimally opacified and contrast opacification was not \npursued to the\nterminal ileum.  There is dilation of small bowel loops at the \nJJ anastomosis.\nMild reflux of contrast past the GE junction into the distal ___ \nof the\nesophagus is noted.  \n \nIMPRESSION:\n1.  Status post gastric bypass, with complete reversal.  \nContrast passes from\nthe stomach into the duodenum and then jejunum as intended, \nwithout\nextravasation of contrast to suggest fistula or leak.  \n2.  Thickened and edematous gastric folds, likely secondary to \nprior\nsurgeries. \n3.  Mild reflux at the GE junction into the distal ___ of the \nesophagus. \n.\n.\nEGD: \nFindings:\nEsophagus:\nMucosa:Erosive esophagitis with ulcerations and contact \nbleeding was seen extending up to 28cm. Cold forceps biopsies \nwere performed for histology at the esophagus; biopsies were \nalso sent for viral culture. \nStomach:\nOtherAn end-end gastrojejunal anastomosis was seen, with a \nsmall remnant gastric pouch. There was also a suture with \ngranulomatous tissue around it in the proximal gastric pouch. \nBile was seen in the remnant gastric pouch as well. \nJejunum:Normal jejunum.\nImpression:Esophagitis (biopsy)\nAn end-end gastrojejunal anastomosis was seen, with a small \nremnant gastric pouch. There was also a suture with \ngranulomatous tissue around it in the proximal gastric pouch. \nBile was seen in the remnant gastric pouch as well.\nOtherwise normal EGD to jejunum\nRecommendations:F/u biopsies\nFurther management per inpatient team\n.\nGI BIOPSY: \nPATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:\nEsophageal mucosal biopsy:\n - Squamous mucosa, with rare eosinophils, spongiosis and \nincreased\nbasal zone regeneration, consistent with mildly active \nesophagitis.\n.\nGI BIOPSY: \nime Taken Not Noted     Log-In Date/Time: ___ 2:07 pm\n      VIRAL CULTURE: R/O CYTOMEGALOVIRUS     Site: ESOPHAGUS\n      TEST VERIFIED BY ___ ___. \n\n   VIRAL CULTURE: R/O CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (Preliminary): \n      No Cytomegalovirus (CMV) isolated. \n\n   CYTOMEGALOVIRUS EARLY ANTIGEN TEST (SHELL VIAL METHOD) (Final \n___: \n      Negative for Cytomegalovirus early antigen by \nimmunofluorescence. \n      Refer to culture results for further information. \n\n   VIRAL CULTURE: R/O HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS (Preliminary): \n      No Herpes simplex (HSV) virus isolated. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: \n___ year old female with multiple medical problems including \ndistant gastric bypass with multiple complications and \nsubsequent surgeries, chronic abdominal pain on methadone, and \npulmonary embolism now on lovenox who presents with 3 days of \nodynophagia and burning chest pain.\n.\n#ODYNOPHAGIA / ESOPHAGITIS: Her presentation was most consistent \nwith esophagitis due to GERD.  She underwent EGD that confirmed \nesophagitis (grossly and on biopsy).  VIral culture was \nnegative.  She has a history of ___ esophagitis (___) but \nbiopsy did not demonstrate fungus.  HIV test was negative. She \nwas started on PPI BID and sucrulfate (slurry) 1gram QID.  She \nwas given viscous lidocaine to take prior to meals and was able \nto tolerate a regular diet.  EGD noted bile in the stomach so \nshe was started on cholestyramine.  Small bowel follow through \ndid not demonstrate  fistula between remnant and gastric pouch \ncausing non acid bile reflux.

Biliary dilation on MRCP is stable, but raised \nconcern for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction versus papillary \nstenosis. Gastroenterology was consulted and requested that \nlevels of micronutrients be checked and that calorie counts be \nperformed to clarify oral intake. There was ongoing concern that \npatient takes her medications not as directed and precipitates \nmethadone or opiate withdrawal, which was supported by patient's \nnegative methadone on her tox screen on admission. She was only \nrecently started on Dilaudid, and this was tapered down during \nthe admission.\n- MRCP reviewed and felt to be chronic.  Her pain was felt to be \ndue to reflux esophagitis and possible dysmotility of some sort. \n She was placed on an aggressive GI cocktail.  Her Methadone was \ndecreased to 10mg TID.  Her Dilaudid was weaned off after \ndiscussions with her and her PCP (opiates not started by current \nPCP, ultimate goal to wean off, dependence issues).  She was \ninitiated on Gabapentin in place of this.\n- Outpatient EUS was recommended and scheduled by GI\n\n# Vitamin B12/Copper deficiency: Followed by neurology and felt \nthat long standing weakness may be due to copper deficiency so \nstarted on supplemental copper.

A U/A was negative. She was made \nNPO, including meds; an NGT was placed overnight (___), \ndrained bilious material and was subsequently removed ___ per \npt request. Pt evaluated by bariatric surgery who did not see \nany indication for surgery. Had EGD and EUS ___ (prior to \nadmission) that showed mild esophagitis, small remnant stomach \nwith  gastrojejunal anastamosis, erythema in the stomach, \ndilated pancreatic duct, normal pancreas/pancreatic vasculature. \n Also had MRCP in ___ with recommended repeat MRCP in ___ \nmos. Most likely etiology of abdominal pain/nausea/vomiting is \nconstipation, which may have been precipitated by methadone \nabuse in outpatient setting. Of note, PCP conveyed concern about \npossible methadone abuse.  Ddx includes referred pain from known \nesophagitis vs marginal ulcer at gastrojejunal anastamosis vs \nmalingering. Given reassuring exam, labs and imaging, we managed \nmedically with pantoprazole BID, standing tylenol and home \nmethadone 7.5mg PO TID for pain, and an aggressive bowel regimen \n(senna, colace, miralax, bisacodyl, enema). She was given zofran \nand compazine for nausea with good relief. She was intially made \nNPO, transitioned to clears on ___, and to regular diet on \n___. EKG ___ showed QTc 448 (methadone, zofran can prolong \nQT). EKG ___ with QTc 426. She was weaned to methadone 5mg \nTID and discharged on this dose.  \n.\n# lethargy, pinpoint pupils, slurred speech: First episode \noccurred on ___ of ___. When due for ___ medications, she was \nfound to be AOx1, not compliant with neuro exam, mumbling, with \neyes closed, reported she was unable to move or sit up. \nAwoke/sat up immediately after use of narcan was discussed w/ \nnursing at bedside, reported she did not want narcan and had not \ntaken any extra meds. Neuro exam was then normal. Room search \ninitiated w/no meds found.  Her AM gabapentin, seroquel and \nclonazepam were held. The following AM, she was lethargic, \nslurring her words, unable to fully open eyes, pinpoint pupils.  \nTold her we were going to give narcan.  By the time we returned \nto the room 10 minutes later, she was awake, angry about mention \nof narcan, pupils 2mm and reactive.  Concerning for neurologic \nabnormality vs seizure vs pseudoseizure vs taking medications we \nare not administering. CT head was negative for acute \nabnormalities.  Compazine was discontinued as this was the only \nnew medication we had started.  Methadone was decreased from \nhome dose of 7.5 mg TID to 5mg TID. She was monitored on \ntelemetry for > 24 hrs with no other episodes.\n. \n# Moderate malnutrition with Vitamin B12/Copper deficiency: \nPreviously followed by nutrition. Albumin 3.8 on ___.  \nRestarted home copper gluconate, Vitamin D, Thiamine, \nCyanocobalamin, Multivitamins W/minerals once she was tolerating \nPO. Nutrition was consulted and recommended continuation of \nregular diet with addition of multivitamin and carnation drink \nTID. \n. \n# Hx of DVT with PE in ___ in setting of recent \nhospitalization and immobilization: Pt reports taking coumadin \n4mg ___ and 5mg all other days, although her INR was 1.0 on \nadmission. Followed by Dr. ___ home health aide that \nchecks her INR). Continued home coumadin with lovenox bridge \nwith INR 1.0 at time of discharge.

It is possible that her GI \nabsorption is too poor to achieve a therapeutic INR. She is \ndischarged on a lovenox bridge and her home coumadin dose. An \nINR should be checked on ___, with anti-coagulation to be \nmanaged by Dr. ___.\n- Concern for QT prolongation given methadone and zofran use. \nHer QTc was 426 on ___ and should be rechecked at her next PCP \n___.\n- Patient was continued on home methadone 7.5mg TID for pain \nwhile inpatient. On ___ of ___ she was found to be AOx1, not \ncompliant with neuro exam, mumbling, with eyes closed, reported \nshe was unable to move or sit up.

You were \nadmitted for nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.  This was \ninitially concerning for a possible small bowel obstruction, but \nan abdominal xray and abdominal cat scan did not show any \nevidence of obstruction.  Bariatric surgery evaluated you and \nrecommended medical management. The most likely cause of your \nnausea, vomiting and abdominal pain is severe constipation.  \nYour symptoms improved with anti-nausea medications and an \naggressive bowel regimen.  As we discussed, methadone and other \nopiate medications (such as dilaudid, morphine, oxycodone) \nfrequently cause constipation.  We encourage you to work with \nDr. ___ to decrease the amount of methadone you take at \nhome. We have prescibed several medications to help with your \nconstipation.  We recommend that you use senna, colace and \nmiralax daily.  The bisacodyl (by mouth and/or per rectum) and \nthe fleet enema should be used only if you become constipated. \nYou were noted to be very confused and slurring on ___ night \nand ___ morning. We held your medications briefly and \ndecreased your methadone given our concern that your medications \nwere interacting. You did not have further episodes of \nconfusion.\nYour INR (a measure of your coumadin activity) was also very low \nwhen you arrived, suggesting that there was no protective effect \nof coumadin in your body.  We started you on lovenox to help \nprevent blood clots while the coumadin level builds back up.  \nYou should continue to take both lovenox and coumadin at home \nand have your INR checked on ___.  Once your INR is \nat a protective level, you can stop taking the lovenox.  This \nwill be coordinated by your PCP, ___. \nPlease follow up at the appointment listed below.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"

NG tube was placed but \ncame out overnight. Most likely etiology for her prior \npresentation was constipation, which may have been precipitated \nby methadone abuse in outpatient setting. Her symptoms at that \ntime wre managed medically with pantoprazole BID, standing \ntylenol and home methadone 7.5mg PO TID for pain, and an \naggressive bowel regimen (senna, colace, miralax, bisacodyl, \nenema). Her PCP had emailed on admission regarding concerns \nabout using methadone excessively at home, running out, then \nwithdrawing, and was in the process fo tapering methadone down \nas an outpatient. There have been concerns about opiate use in \nthe past as an outpatient. She was given zofran and compazine \nfor nausea with good relief. She transitioned from NPO to \nregular diet at that time within 48 hr of admission. EKG ___ \nshowed QTc 448, EKG ___ with QTc 426. She was weaned to \nmethadone 5mg TID and discharged on this dose. Of note she had \nseveral episodes of altered mental status w/ pinpoint pupils \nthat resolved spontaneously w/o narcan.

CT abd-pelvis with oral contrast \nshowed no obstruction but significant constipation. She was seen \nby Bariatric surgery who recommended admission to Medicine if pt \nunable to tolerate PO's and treatment with 40 BID PPI, carafate, \nand banana bag. In the ED she was not able to tolerate PO. \nPatient was informed that narcotic pain medications will be \navoided as this will worsen her constipation which is likely the \nreason for her symptoms.  \nIn the ED she was given NS 3L, Dilaudid, Zofran, Acetaminophen, \nProtonix, Thiamine, FOlic Acid.  \nVitals prior to transfer were: 98.6 93 148/90 20 100% RA.  \nOn the floor, she reports that since discharge she has only had \none small BM 4 days ago. She feels that she never got better. \nReports emesis of bilious material ___ and continued \nepigastric burning worse when lying flat. Diffuse abdominal pain \nL>R.

Stable ___ opacities at the bases of the lungs \nbilaterally, likely secondary to small airways infection or \naspiration.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ with history of gastric bypass s/p reversal, esophagitis, \nchronic pain, PE presenting with odynophagia, nausea and \nabdominal pain.\n\n# Odynophagia: Differential included recurrent esophagitis vs \nesophageal or anastamotic ulcer vs infection. Without fevers and \nWBC stable from prior with known history of esophagitis and \nreport of lack of adherence to PPI at home, esophagitis was \nthought to be most likely etiology of ___ pain. Her \nesophagitis may also have been worsened by worsened reflux \nrelated to her constipation as below. Given stable hematocrit \nand no evidence of bleeding on exam, EGD was deferred on this \nadmission. Patient was treated with IV PPI BID then transitioned \nto omeprazole BID. Her pain was controlled with home methadone, \nsucralfate and maalox/diphenhydramine/lidocaine mouth wash with \ngood effect and patient was able to tolerate POs prior to \ndischarge. Patient should continue BID PPI until follow-up with \nGI as an outpatient next month. \n\n#Abdominal Pain/nausea/vomiting: Patient with significant pain \nto palpation particularly at LLQ with evidence of significant \nstool burden on CT abdomen on admission and no bowel movement \nfor 6 days prior to admission. No evidence of infection based on \nCT abdomen, WBC count and temperature (afebrile). Likely that \n___ constipation worsened by methadone and zofran which \ncan be constipating. Constipation treated with multiple mineral \noil and tap water enemas as well as miralax, colace and senna \nwith improvement in constipation and abdominal pain. Nausea \nimproved with relief of constipation and IV zofran. Patient was \ntransitioned back to higher dose of PO zofran prior to discharge \nwhich she tolerated well. Patient discharged on aggressive bowel \nregimen. Methadone (likely cause of constipation) to be tapered \nper PCP as below.\n\n# Chronic Pain: Per Dr. ___ PCP), patient is \ncurrently tapering methadone and was scheduled to taper to 5mg \ndaily on day of admission. In the setting of symptoms consistent \nwith esophagitis, further taper of methadone deferred and \npatient was continued on previous dosing of methadone 5mg BID \nwith plan for follow-up at ___ office on ___ for discussion \nregarding further methadone taper. \n\n# Pinpoint pupils and mild impaired responsiveness: Patient with \ndifficulty waking from sleep AM of ___ for ___ minutes. She was \nnoted to be difficult to wake fully with pinpoint pupils, \nanswering questions but unable to move more than a few inches in \nbed. Spontaneously improved with pupils dilated to baseline. \nUnclear etiology. No known seizure history, no post-ictal state. \nNeurology was curbsided and did not reel that description was \nconsistent with any classic seizure presentation. Patient with \nsimilar issue on last admission and is not sure if this happens \nsometimes at home as well. Other considerations for etiology \ninclude sleep disorder vs medication effect given multiple \ncentral acting medications. Patient scheduled for outpatient \nneurology follow-up. Would also consider outpatient sleep study \nif this persists. \n\n# Hx of DVT with PE in ___: PE and DVTs in setting of \nhospitalization and immobilization. Patient with subtherapeutic \n(normal) INR on admission with concern that patient has either \nnot been taking her coumadin or has been unable to absorb \nrelated to prior abdominal surgeries. Patient was continued on \nenoxaparin 70 BID and coumadin 7mg daily on this admission. INR \nof 1.0 on discharge. \n\n  \n# Depression/anxiety: Patient continued on home buproprion, \nclonazepam, doxepin, mirtazapine and seroquel once able to \ntolerate PO medications (HD2).\n \n--\nTransitional Issues:\n- Code: DNR/DNI (confirmed)\n- Emergency Contact: ___ (daughter and HCP): \n___\n- Please repeat MRCP in ___ or ___ for follow-up of possible \nsphincter of Oddi dysfunction\n- Consider social work for placement into day program. At this \ntime, ___ daughter comfortable with patient coming home \nbut concerned about her day time activities and hopeful for \nrespite during the day to help her mom improve\n-Patient with recurrent episode of lethargy on waking, pinpoint \npupils that spontaneously resolved. Per discussion with neuro, \nsymptoms not consistent with seizures but would consider further \nneuro work-up as outpatient and possible sleep study given \nepisodes occur when waking up\n-Continue taper of methadone to 5mg daily and off \n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

She was seen by \nour GI consultants as well who also considered whether she might \nhave an element of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction or ampullary \nstenosis.  They recommended slowly advancing diet as tolerated, \nno plans for endoscopic studies in-house (especially during \nacute exacerbation), and close f/u with GI Dr. ___ \nconsideration of repeat EGD/EUS (ampulla and CBD not visualized \nlast time due to changed anatomy) with possible colonoscopy (hx \nFe deficiency anemia).\n\nShe is now tolerating a regular diet.  We have recommended low \nfat diet with frequent small meals.  \n\n#DVT/PE - continued on lovenox (sub therapeutic INR) and \ncoumadin.  She missed dose of coumadin on ___, held in case any \nstudies planned.\n.\nEsophagitis:  continued PPI\n.\nChronic pain: now off narcotics, tapered off methadone as outpt. \n Continue neurontin.  GI also recommended consideration of \ntricyclic such as amitriptyline for control of chronic pain.  We \navoided opioids during this admission due to her well-reported \npast history of narcotic abuse.  She did receive several doses \nof tramadol in-house which she felt helped her pain, but after \ndiscussion with her PCP, we decided no further tramadol as an \noutpt due to the potential for drug-drug interactions with her \npsychotropic meds.\n\n.\nAnxiety and depression \nContinue bupropion/clonazepam/remeron\n.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Now with post prandial \nepigastric pain and odynophagia. EGD notable for esophagitis and \ngastritis; biopsies taken and showed persistent ___. She was \ncontinued on her home PPI and sucralfate with the addition of \ncholestyramine and started on PO fluconazole. She did not \ntolerate cholestyramine. Given ongoing pain, while in house she \nwas evaluated by the bariatric surgery team who did not think \nthat surgical intervention would improve bile reflux. She was \nalso seen by the pain management team who recommended outpatient \nnerve block given concern for nerve entrapment at surgical site \nand continued use of tramadol PRN. She will need outpatient \nfollow-up with ___ further evaluation and treatment. \nFluconazole will finish on ___.\n\n# Leukopenia- Noted on previous admissions as well. Resolved \nwithout intervention. \n\n# Malnutrition: due to odynophagia.

Medications discussed with patient's PCP, \n___, and outpatient nurse. Gabapentin was stopped, \nSeroquel was continued at 100mg qAM and 300mg qPM (but decreased \nwhen fluconazole was started due to interaction), and Klonipin \nwas continued at 0.5mg qAM and 2mg qPM (tapered to 1.5 mg after \n1 week per outpt psychiatrist). She was instructed to choose one \npharmacy to fill all of her prescriptions at to limit confusion \nin the future. She will need close outpatient follow-up with her \nPCP and psychiatrist for further titration of her psychiatric \nmedications.\n\n# hx narcotics abuse: pt was continued on home ___.  Pain \nmanagement was discussed with ___ provider who \npreferred not to dc the patient on ultram, however given ongoing \npain and pain consult recommendations, this was continued. \n\nOUTSTANDING ISSUE:\n-pt to completed 14 day course of fluconazole for esophageal \ncandidiasis\n-ultram should be tapered to complete discontinuation in ___ \ndays\n-pt should follow up in pain management clinic\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

She completed a 5 day course of \nzosyn.\n\n# Leukocytosis: Patient with an increased leukocytosis from 4.8 \nto 12.1 while on ceftriaxone for UTI (see above), which could \nrepresent a stress response given recent EGD and upper GI bleed. \nCXR without pneumonia, blood cultures no growth to date. She was \ntreated for UTI as above, with resolution of her leukocytosis. \n\n# Anticoagulation for history of DVT/PE in ___. Coumadin held \nat rehab given concern for GI bleed. Admission INR of 1.2. Prior \nhematology notes recommended ongoing anticoagulation while the \npatient is immobile, particularly during hospitalizations given \nthe extent of her prior VTE.  As she was admitted with UGIB, her \ncoumadin continued to be held. As her H/H were subsequently \nstable, the risks and benefits of resuming coumadin. Her \ncoumadin was restarted with Lovenox SC as bridging therapy. On \nthe day of discharge her INR was 2.1 so her Lovenox was stopped. \nHer INR should be checked daily until her INR stabilizes.\n\n# Acute on Chronic abdominal pain: Patient has a history of \nchronic abdominal pain, and a history of prior narcotic abuse. \nCT A/P was obtained given worsening abdominal pain that was \nnegative for acute process. She was continued on her home \nmethadone, oxycodone, senna, and sulcrafate. \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES: \n\n# History of CVA: Patient has residual left sided weakness. \nLikely not on aspirin given NSAIDS allergy. No record of atrial \nfibrillation of known cause. She reports recrudescence of \nsymptoms which occured in the setting of holding warfarin for an \noutpatient spinal surgery. We attempted unsuccessfully to obtain \nOSH records. Given her severe esophagitis, the risks and \nbenefits of anticoagulation were discussed with the patient and \nthe family, and decision was made to restart anticoagulation \nwith warfarin. \n \n# Anxiety/depression:  Continued home medications: seroquel, \nclonazepam, BuPROPion, Doxepin.\n\n===== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =====\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n- Given severe esophagitis, patient should be continued on high \ndose PPI BID.\n- Risks/benefits of anticoagulation were discussed with the \nfamily, and the patient was resumed on coumadin; given severe \nesophagitis and risk of re-bleed, recommend re-checking \nhemoglobin/hematocrit on ___.

Our \ngastroenterologist took another look down your throat with a \ncamera and saw irritation of your esophagus that has improved \ncompared to the last study. However, we still believe that this \nis the source of your bleeding. We temporarily stopped your \ncoumadin to reduce the risk of further bleeding. We monitored \nyour blood work to make sure you weren't continuing to lose \nblood and the values remained stable. We then restarted your \nanticouagulation on coumadin slowly and gave you another \nmedication, lovenox, to keep your blood the coumadin works. \nYou will need to take the lovenox until your INR is stable \nbetween ___. You can have your blood measured as an outpatient. \n\nAlso during this hospitalization, you had worsening of your \nabdominal pain. This pain is most likely related to the irration \nof your esophagus provoked while vomiting. The Gastroenterology \ndoctors also performed ___ abdominal Xray which showed that you \nwere severely constipated. This can result from taking opioid \npain relievers. The GI doctors also repeated a CAT scan of your \nstomach. There was no evidence of a fistula or any other \nconcerning findings on this image. \n\nPlease ensure that you get your INR measured soon so that your \ncoumadin can be dosed properly.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"

On hospital day 2, she began to complain of increased \nSOB and non-productive cough. CXR showed opacification at the \nLLL and she was started on a 5 day course of Levaquin to be \ncompleted on ___ in the outpatient setting. Blood and urine \ncultures are still pending. She had no other signs of infection; \nUA was negative, she had dilated biliary ducts that in the \nsetting of normal LFTs were unconcerning for cholangitis given \nher presentation. \n\n# abd pain: the pt also presented with chronic abdominal pain \nthat was at the level that it normally was at her nursing home. \nCT AP showed no cause for concern for acute pathology. Her \nabdominal pain was believed to be due to strictures and \nmanipulation of the abdomen from multiple abdominal surgeries. \nThe pt had a history of opiate abuse, and presented from rehab \non 20 mg methadone TID and dilaudid ___ mg PO q4h for pain. \nDuring her hospitalization she was noted to be more drowsy with \na respiratory rate of 12 overnight so her dilaudid was decreased \nto ___ mg PO q4h as needed for pain. She was also treated with \nTylenol q8h. \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES \n\n# History of DVT/PE: the pt reported that she is on life-long \nanticoagulation for DVT/PE. She reported that about 1 week prior \nto admission, she had noticed swelling in her right leg at the \nnursing home. She also reported mild \"throbbing\" pain in the \nRLE. There was no swelling or warmth on exam, and the patient \ncontinued to be therapeutic on her warfarin. \n \n# Chronic pain, anxiety: the pt was continued on her home \ngabapentin, clonazepam.\n\n***Transitional issues***: \n- Pneumonia: pt was started on Levaquin ___, end date is \n___. CXR on ___ showed opacification at the LLL, this should \nbe followed up to resolution with a repeat CXR greater than 6 \nweeks in the future. \n- dilated biliary ducts: seen on CT AP. While this could be \nchronic, MRCP or ERCP should be considered in the future\n-During this hospitalization, there were times when the patient \nappeared very somnolent after her home medications were \nadministered. There is concern that she may be overmedicated \nwith opioids and other sedating meds. Please consider tapering \ndilaudid, methadone, clonopin and Seroquel.\n\nFULL CODE \n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

These findings suggest acute \nto subacute \ninfarction of the right cerebellum.  No additional areas of \ninfarction are \nidentified.  There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, \nmass effect, \nor midline shift.  The ventricles and sulci are normal in \ncaliber and \nconfiguration.  There is no abnormal enhancement after contrast \nadministration. \n  \nIMPRESSION:  \n  \nThree punctate areas decreased diffusion in the right cerebellar \nhemisphere, \none of which has correlating FLAIR abnormality, suggest acute to \nsubacute \nright cerebellar infarction.  No evidence of hemorrhage or other \ninfarction. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ year old F with prior CVA with L sided weakness and facial\ndroop, history of gastric bypass, gastritis, DVT/PE on\nanticoagulation, and chronic pain and anxiety on multiple pain\nmedications who is now admitted due to concern for altered \nmental\nstate at home. Mental status improved after holding back on\nsedating meds, but MRI showed new right-sided cerebellar stroke. \n\n\n# Altered mental state.  The patient was discharged from her \nprevious hospital stay with clear mental status and no acute \nneuro abnormalities.  However, on arrival to her home, she was \nnoted to have slurred speech per her family and brought to the \nER.  She was admitted to medicine where her sedating medications \nwere tapered, back to Dilaudid 2mg every 4 hours and \nPromethazine to 6.25 (previously getting 25 last hospital stay). \n Her mental status was back to normal with this change.  There \nwas no evidence of metabolic abnormalities or infection that \ncould have been the culprit for her encephalopathy.  I spoke \nwith her PCP, ___, who understood the concerns for \nsedating medications, and acknowledged that he shares the goal \nof tapering them further.  We found a bottle of Dilaudid that \nshe had from discharge that was empty in the bed.  She could not \nfully explain why the bottle did not have the pills in it that \nwere supposed to last 5 days were gone in 2.  We have concerns, \nas does her sister ___, that the patient is not taking her \nmedications at home appropriately, forgets doses, and may take \ntoo many, as she is forgetful.  We suggested that she have \nfurther assistance at home or elsewhere, but she wanted to \nreturn to her home.  We will add services such as ___ in addition \nto nursing services that already exist.  \n\n#Acute/Subacute stroke in the right cerebellum.  The patient had \nan MRI on her second hospital day which showed the above \nfindings.  She was seen by the neurology team who recommended \nthat she have a CTA head and neck as well as an echo with bubble \nstudy.  The strokes were likely embolic in etiology given their \nlocation, and with Lupus anticoagulant positive (one time), this \nraised suspicion that she may have an underlying thrombophilia \ngiven her recent strokes in the past.  The patient has been on \nXarelto for months, and claims to be compliant with this. We \nwere unable to determine if she was non-compliant given above \nissues, or if she were compliant, which would represent a \nfailure of Xarelto.  If she were to fail Xarelto, she could \nconsider Coumadin with INR goal > 2.5.  However, with Hx of 2 GI \nbleeds, this poses risks.  After extensive counseling with the \npatient about the risks and benefits of remaining on Xarelto for \nthe interim, she elected to do this, realizing that there is a \nrisk of further thrombosis.  She will see a stroke specialist as \nan outpatient as well as a hematologist. She was unable to \ncomplete CTA secondary to IV infiltration, and inability to \nplace another one. She declined a midline and said she would be \nbetter hydrated as an outpatient and try again.  Echo was done \nthe evening prior to discharge, where the results are pending at \nthe time of discharge. Her neurologist will use the results to \nhelp determine next steps in treatment. \n\nTotal cholesterol 118 HDL 64 LDL 67 ___ 381; no acute statin \ntherapy was recommended by Neurology, but her stroke MD can \ndecide whether adding one would be beneficial.  She reports an \nallergy to ASA \"upset stomach.\"  Her SBPs has been \nwell-controlled with values averaging 100-130. \n\n# Chronic abdominal and back pain - Her hydrophorphone at prior \ndose of 2mg q4prn, and she continued on methadone at ___s Gabapentin.  \n\n# Anxiety/Depression - continued home meds below, but one \nevening, Clonopin was held secondary to sedation.  \n- clonazepam 0.5 bid\n- buproprion 150 bid\n- quetiapine 75 qhs\n- doxepin 100 qhs\n\n# Gastritis/esophagitis\n- continue Carafate\n- continue pantoprazole \n- continue ranitidine\n\n# CODE STATUS: full\n\n#Dispo - I had a conversation with the patient's sister ___ \n(pt gave consent) who expressed concerns about the patient being \nable to live at home by herself successfully.  She notes that \nthe frequent bounce-backs are a product of her having \ndifficulties in the home and thinks that she would be better in \na closely supervised setting, such as the assisted living-like \nenvironment she was in for ___ years.  I explained that I also \nexpressed these concerns to the patient, but she was adamant \nthat she remain in her home.  She was able to articulate the \nrisks, benefits, and alternatives of doing so.  She was \nagreeable to have more home services. I encouraged her sister to \nshare her concerns with the patient's living environment with \nthe patient herself, as this is ultimately her choice as to \nwhere she lives given her capacity to make her own decisions.  \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

CT \nabdomen/pelvis, LFTs and lipase were unremarkable and the n/v \nwas suspected to either be a benign viral gastroenteritis, or to \nbe related to headache. A new severe headache in a ___ year old \npatient was felt to be concerning for secondary headache.\n   The headache was right-sided, radiating from the occiput to \nbehind the R eye. Neuro exam unchanged from baseline other than \na left-sided visual field defect, which is of unclear chonicity; \notherwise no symptomatic evidence of new stroke. Follow-up \nMRI/MRA was only notable for a questionable punctate infarction \nin the left pons, though imaging artifact was also possible. CRP \nwnl, effectively ruling out temporal arteritis. \n   Pseudotumor cerebri was considered, although fundoscopic exam \nwas without papilledema and bedside ultrasound of optic nerve \nalso did not suggest increased sheath diameter. LP was planned, \nbut aborted at the last minute upon realization that the patient \nhad already received lovenox that day. She subsequently improved \nwith symptomatic treatment; thus, LP was deferred. The etiology \nremained unclear at discharge and she will follow up in headache \nclinic.\n\n#Abdominal pain\n#Chronic pain\n#Hx of opiate use disorder\nPt w/ acute on chronic abdominal pain x 1 day, initial exam \nnotable for epigastric and LUQ TTP. Lipase, LFTs unremarkable. \nCT abd/pelvis without acute etiology. Believed to be chronic \nbaseline pain that worsened in the setting of nausea/vomiting. \nShe was continued on methadone, dilaudid, gabapentin, and \nTylenol with minimal additional dilaudid doses required. Weaned \nback to home regimen by discharge.\n\n#Lethargy\nAppeared lethargic on admission but otherwise oriented. She \nreported this was her baseline. There were no clear metabolic \nderangements nor evidence of infectious etiology. Lethargy \nimproved some during hospitalization and was overall thought to \nbe related to polypharmacy in the setting of methadone, \ndilaudid, gabapentin, and clonazepam. \n\n#Recurrent CVA on Anticoagulation\nHas a history of CVA while on xarelto. On that prior admission, \nneurology had wanted CTA head/neck and TTE w/ bubble, but these \nhad not been completed so were belatedly completed on this \nadmission. MRA Neck/Head done during this hospitalization was \noverall unremarkable, other than a questionable punctate \ninfarction in the left pons, though this had no obvious clinical \ncorrelate and imaging artifact was also possible. TTE with \nbubble study was done, and it did not show any PFO or ASD. \nRivaroxaban was briefly switched to lovenox due to nausea and \npoor po intake; however she was switched back to xarelto prior \nto discharge. Of note, her prior positive lupus anticoagulant \nwas felt to be a likely false positive, so a repeat was drawn \nwhile the patient was off anticoagulation as requested by \nHeme/onc, pending at discharge.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES ADDRESSED:\n=========================\n#Unintentional Weight Loss\n#Abnormal Urine Cytology\nPresented following 60 lbs unintentional weight loss (though \nseems that pt gained 60 lbs then lost 60 lbs within last year). \nShe reports good appetite and po intake prior to her recent \nnausea and vomiting. No fever or night sweats. Of note, she \npreviously had an abnormal urine cytology suspicious for high \ngrade urothelial carcinoma but follow-up cytology was normal. \nHer last colonoscopy in ___ showed polyps. She was unsure when \nher last mammography occurred. Recommend urology follow-up and \ncancer screening as an outpatient. \n\nMEDICATION CHANGES:\n===================\n- None\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n===================\n[ ] Recent weight loss - needs malignancy screening (last \nmammography unknown, last pap unknown, still has not completed \ncystoscopy for prior hematuria and abnormal urine cytology)\n[ ] Will follow up with primary care provider\n[ ] Will follow up with neurology to continue post-stroke care \nand consider further workup for headaches, if indicated. \n[ ] Question of visual field defect on bedside exam; Will \nfollow-up ophthalmology\n[ ] Consider repeat MRI brain in ___ weeks to reevaluate \nquestionable new punctate pontine lesion.\n[ ] If headaches return, consider lumbar puncture to \nconclusively rule out pseudotumor cerebri.\n[ ] Continue to work on decreasing her multiple sedating \nmedications if possible\n\n#CODE: Full (presumed) \n#CONTACT: HCP: mom ___ ___\n \n___ on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

TTE with normal systolic \nfunction, valvular function, and pulmonary pressures, CXR clear, \nBNP normal. Patient noted to have severe protein-calorie \nmalnutrition, likely etiology of her lower extremity edema.  She \nwas initially admitted to the cardiology service where she was \ngiven diuresis, which lead to orthostasis, so Midodrine was \nadded.  They initiated tube feeds via NGT and then transferred \nher to the hospitalist service on the ___. \n\n=================\nACTIVE ISSUES\n=================\n# Severe protein-calorie malnutrition c/b peripheral edema: \nPatient noted to have severe malnutrition in setting of prior \ngastric bypass. GI recommended that the patient take small, \nfrequent meals. The cardiology team, along with Nutrition \ndecided to place an NGT tube, and the patient was initiated on \ntube feeds. In discussion with this team, there was no planned \nend-point in this therapy.  I discussed with her primary \noutpatient GI MD. ___ stated that her weight fluxuates, and that \nthe TFs are unnecessary.  In addition, she experienced nausea, \nbloating, and some abdominal pain with these.  The NG tube was \nremoved, and her symptoms improved.  She was able to eat \nsufficient meals and was pleased with her progress.  She will \nfollow-up with Gastroenterology as well as nutrition as an \noutpatient. All of her home medications were kept the same as \nthey were on admission.  \n\n___ edema - the patient had SaO2 of ___ in clinic; however, when \nshe was admitted to the floor, ambulatory SaO2 was 94-95% on RA \nper the report of the medical resident.  The Cardiology team \ntreated her empirically for diastolic heart failure with \nTorsemide, which caused diuresis but also orthostasis.  \nTorsemide was stopped, and we instituted TEDS as well as \nlymphedema wraps.  Wee discussed that mechanical (wraps), and \nnot medical therapy would be best ___ for symptoms of this \nnature.  I also explained that dizziness or orthostasis should \nbe dealt with by having slower movements with position changes.  \nMidodrine was added but caused nausea symptoms, so this was not \nadvised to continue and also to reduce polypharmacy.  \n\n# AVNRT: Patient had single episode of AVNRT that \nself-terminated and has not recurred. Question whether her \npresenting symptom of shortness of breath was perhaps an \narrhythmia, but no further events occurred on telemetry, and she \nexperienced this symptom without any arrhythmia on the monitor.  \nThere is no need for further monitoring at this time.  \n\n# DVT/PE: Patient previously on warfarin but switched to \nrivaroxaban, possibly at a prior rehab stay this year. Patient \ndid have a stroke while on rivaroxaban. Given her gastric bypass \nand limited ability to eat a 500-calorie meal, rivaroxaban may \nbe poorly absorbed and therefore less effective; however, her \nhome compliance with meds is also in question which may have led \nto failure. She was able to take enough food to have AC to be \neffective.  There is no need to consider switching back to \nwarfarin for anticoagulation at this time.  \n\n#Stage II sacral ulcer - she should have off-loading for sitting \nand lying; ___ will continue dressing changes.   \n\n=================\nCHRONIC ISSUES\n=================\n# Chronic Pain\n# Substance Abuse: Patient has ___ of chronic abdominal pain \nsecondary to multiple\nsurgeries as well as ___ substance abuse. She is on a complex \npain regimen, which has been continued while inpatient.  Because \nshe missed her outpatient appointment for refill of Methadone, I \ngave her her 9 pills to last ___, and ___ - \n___.  She states that she has enough at home for ___ and \n___ and can get additional refills with her PCP in the next \nfew days to resume on ___.

LENIS at that time were negative for clot. Patient \nwithout evidence of diastolic HF on recent ECHO. Patient \ncontinues to have severe malnutrition which is likely the source \nof her lower extremity edema. Current albumin is quiet low at \n1.2 which is even further decreased from her last stay.  The \npatient had recent feeding tube initiation while on the \nCardiology service, but feeds were not tolerated as she had \nabdominal pain, nausea, bloating. Prior hospitalist also reports \nspeaking with her outpatient GI who did not feel tube feeds were \nnecessary. The patient noted increased po intake towards the end \nof her last hospitalization and thus tube feeds were \ndiscontinued. GI recommended gastroparesis diet with small \nfrequent meals and outpatient follow up after her last \ndischarge. During this hospitalization, patient was encouraged \nto consume regular meals which she tolerated well. However, this \nwill be an ongoing issue moving forwards that needs regular \nsurveillance. Continued thiamine, ferrous sulfate, folic acid, \ncyancobalamin, ascorbic acid, multivitamin, vitamin D.  \n\n# Anemia. Patient with anemia with Hb 7.1 on admission. Anemia \nof chronic disease on prior admissions. No bleeding per patient \nhx in urine, stool, or vaginal. Likely worsened because of \nsevere malnutrition. Hb dropped to 6.9 during this admission and \nshe received one unit of PRBC with response to Hb 8.3. On \ndischarge, the Hb was 8.9.\n\n# Pyuria, Urinary tract infection. Patient with positive urine \nanalysis, but no urinary symptoms including dysuria, urinary \nfrequency or urgency. Deferred antibiotics initially given \nabsence of dysuria. However, the patient had intermittent \nepisodes of confusion that could have been attributed to UTI. \nCulture grew pseudomonas, pan-sensitive. She was given 3 days of \nciprofloxacin ___ after AM dose).\n\n# Chronic Pain\n# Substance Abuse\nPatient has h/o chronic abdominal pain  secondary to multiple \nsurgeries as well as h/o substance abuse per prior discharge \nsummary. She is on a complex  pain regimen. Discuss limiting \nnarcotics as they will exacerbate her gastroparesis and limit \nher po intake. Uptitrated gabapentin and uptitrated duloxetine \n___, which can both provide enhanced pain control without \nadditional narcotics.\n\n#Chest heaviness:\nAt her baseline. Unlikely ACS with two rounds of troponins \nnegative. Patient without evidence of edema/opacity on her CXR \nto suggest heart failure or PNA. Likely related to overall \nsensation of generalized swelling. \n\n# DVT/PE: \nPatient previously on warfarin but switched to rivaroxaban, \npossibly at a prior rehab stay this year. Warfarin has difficult \nabsorption in patients with gastric bypass and it is difficult \nto remain in a therapeutic range. Patient did have a stroke \nwhile on rivaroxaban which may be in the setting of her gastric \nbypass (it cannot be absorbed). Of note Apixiban does have \nadequate absorption in gastric bypass patients, and she has been \ntransitioned to this medication. \n\n=================\nCHRONIC ISSUES\n=================\n# Depression/Anxiety. Continued home bupropion, duloxetine, \ndoxepin, queitiapine\n\n# GERD/gastroparesis: Continued home ranitidine, promethazine, \nPPI, and sucralfate\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n=================\n#NEW MEDICATIONS\n- Apixaban 5 mg PO/NG BID \n- Multivitamins W/minerals 1 TAB PO DAILY \n- Ciprofloxacin HCl 250 mg PO/NG Q12H Duration 3 days to \ncomplete ___ after AM dose\n\n#CHANGED MEDICATIONS\n- Gabapentin 300 mg PO/NG TID \n\n#STOPPED MEDICATIONS\n- Multivitamins 1 TAB PO DAILY\n- Rivaroxaban 20 mg PO DAILY \n\n[ ] Pseudomonas simple cystitis treatment to complete ___ \nafter Am dose (for 3 day course)\n[ ] Has severe protein calorie malnutrition. Continue to monitor \npo intake\n[ ] Has anemia of chronic disease, continue to monitor\n[ ] Previously on Xarelto, however given history of gastric \nbypass, switched to Apixaban due to concern for adequate \nabsorption with Xarelto\n[ ] Has chronic abdominal pain for which home \nduloxetine/gabapentin were uptitrated, rather than adding on \nadditional narcotic agents\n[ ] Anemia requiring transfusion.

She was diagnosed with a UTI and\ntreated with ciprofloxacin and then discharged to rehab.  She \nhas\nremained in rehab over the past 10 days with similar symptoms. \n\nIn the past 2 days at rehab, she has noted that her breathing \nhas\nbecome worse.  She describes worsened chest heaviness with deep\ninspiration and a chronic chest heaviness that is similar in\nquality to her chronic symptoms, although slightly worse.  She\nnotes the chest pressure has been continuous in quality and has\nnot dissipated any point.  She denies any orthopnea or PND\nalthough she has not been laying flat at rehab.  She feels that\nher lower extremity edema is stable from his prior ALT though \nher\nmother who is present notes that it might be slightly worse.  \nShe\nthinks that her abdominal pain is worse than baseline although\nher mother endorses that it is likely similar to her chronic\nsymptoms.  Denies any neck back jaw or arm pain.  Denies any\nnumbness or tingling.  She has not had any nausea or vomiting\nwhich marked her prior admissions for edema and abdominal pain. \nDenies any coughs, specifically any productive cough.  Denies \nany\nheadaches, or fevers but says she has had intermittent chills\nover the past 2 weeks.  She has ongoing twitching sensations\nwhich her mother endorses are stable for several months since \nher\nprior strokes.  Denies any urinary urgency, dysuria, frequency \nor\nhematuria.  Completed her antibiotic course as scheduled at\nrehab.   Her mother notes that she has a petechial appearing \nrash\non her arms and legs which was reportedly present on her last\nadmission on her buttocks but has since spread.

No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection. \n2. Large bilateral simple appearing pleural effusions. \n3. Extensive ground-glass opacities throughout the bilateral \nlungs, likely \nsecondary to pulmonary edema however an underlying multifocal \npneumonia cannot be excluded. \n4. Compared to the prior examination, there is extensive edema \nwithin the \nsubcutaneous tissues.  Clinical correlation for volume overload \nis \nrecommended. \n5. Hepatic steatosis. \n6. Sub-centimeter thyroid nodule for which no follow-up is \nrecommended based on ACR criteria listed below. \n\n___ CXR\nThere are multiple pulmonary opacities.  This most likely \nrepresents pulmonary edema however multifocal pneumonia cannot \nbe excluded.  Allowing for differences in technique, this \nappears similar to the CT scan of the chest from ___.   there are bilateral pleural effusions, similar to the \nprevious CT scan.  The heart is not enlarged.  The aorta is \natherosclerotic and tortuous.\n\n___ CT Head\nNo acute intracranial process.\n\n___ TTE\nThe left atrial volume index is normal. Normal left ventricular \nwall thickness, cavity size, and regional/global systolic \nfunction (biplane LVEF = 62 %). The estimated cardiac index is \nnormal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal \nleft ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right \nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. \n[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely \ndepressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There \nis abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with \nright ventricular volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) \nappear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no \naortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve \nappears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. \nThere is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe [3+] \ntricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary \nartery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least \nmoderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated \npulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to \na very high right atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial \neffusion. A very prominent left pleural effusion is present. \nIMPRESSION: Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. \nModerate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Normal biventricular \ncavity sizes with preserved regional and global biventricular \nsystolic function. Compared with the prior study (images \nreviewed) of ___, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation \nand the estimated PA systolic pressure are now much higher. Is \nthere a history to suggest an acute pulmonary process (pulmonary \nembolism, pneumonia, bronchospasm, etc.). \n\n___HEST/ABD/PELVIS W/O \n1. Large acute to subacute left retroperitoneal hematoma, \nintramuscular \nhematomas involving the bilateral psoas and left iliacus muscles \nalso noted.  \nActive bleeding difficult to exclude.  Please correlate \nclinically. \n2. Scattered bilateral pulmonary ground-glass opacities, may \nrepresent \npulmonary edema, with underlying emphysema.  Small to moderate \nleft pleural effusion appears simple. \n3. Support tubes and lines appear in appropriate position. \n4. Other findings as described above. \n\n___ Imaging CTA ABD & PELVIS \nLarge left retroperitoneal hematoma, bilateral intramuscular \npsoas and left iliacus hematomas.  Tiny foci of active bleeding \nwithin the left \nretroperitoneal hematoma and left psoas hematoma, detailed \nabove. \n\n___ Imaging LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US \n1. Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of \nliver disease \nincluding steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or cirrhosis cannot \nbe excluded on the basis of this examination. \n2. No evidence of acute pancreatitis in the imaged portions of \nthe pancreas. \n3. Again seen the 18.6 x 6.3 cm left retroperitoneum hematoma. \n\n___ EEG:\nThis is an abnormal continuous video-EEG monitoring study due to \n\nthe presence of a slow, disorganized theta frequency background \nwith bursts of generalized slowing and bursts of left temporal \nfocal slowing. These findings indicate left temporal subcortical \ndysfunction and a mild diffuse encephalopathy. There were no \nelectrographic seizures.

She was having myoclonic \njerks suggestive of TME, found on EEG to be in non-convulsive \nstatus. Neurology was consulted and titrated anti-epileptic \nmedications in combination until the patient was no longer \nseizing. She was then maintained on lacosamide 200 mg BID & \nlevetiracetam 1500 mg BID.\n\n# Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient developed \nrespiratory failure, etiology is likely multifactorial iso AMS \nw/ status epilepticus, pulmonary edema. She was later diagnosed \nwith ventilator associated pneumonia. Sputum culture ___ grew \nE.coli and Psuedomonas, for which she was started on broad \nspectrum antibiotics and narrowed to ceftazidime prior to \ndischarge for two week course started ___ (end date ___, which \nwill treat possible UTI as well. Patient underwent tracheostomy \n___ in the setting of extended intubation and was maintained \non a tracheostomy mask. She continued to have copious secretions \nand was unable to tolerate a passy muir valve. \n\n# History of DVT/PE on apixaban:\nThe patient has a remote history of DVT/PE and was admitted on \napixaban. She was maintained on a heparin drip during her acute \nillness but suffered a RP bleed (see below) during which her \nheparin drip was discontinued to allow for ___ intervention. Her \nheparin drip was eventually re-started once she was stable & \nthen she was transitioned back to apixaban. Hemoglobin stable \nupon discharge, 8.2 upon day of discharge. \n\n# Retroperitoneal bleed: She had down-trending H/H & was noted \non CTA ___ to have a large left retroperitoneal hematoma, \nbilateral intramuscular psoas and left iliacus hematomas. ___ was \nconsulted and she underwent successful embolization and remained \nhemodynamically stable post-procedure, with stable hemoglobin. \nShe required multiple blood transfusions during admission. \nApixiban was restarted upon discharge given stable hemoglobin. \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n===============\n\n# Severe protein-calorie malnutrition w/ anasarca: She was noted \nto be severely malnourished which is likely due to inadequate GI \nabsorption ___ poor GI anatomy after her RYGB. She was followed \nby Nutrition & supplemented for multiple deficiencies which she \nwill continue upon discharge. A Dobhoff was placed for tube \nfeeding and tube feeds were initiated. \n\n# Chronic Pain: Chronic abdominal pain secondary to multiple \nsurgeries. Home medications include gabapentin 300 mg PO TID, \nmethadone 20 mg PO TID were initially held in the setting of \naltered mental status. These may be restarted after discharge \nupon discretion of PCP. Patient was not in significant pain. She \nreceived PRN PO dilaudid as needed. Discharged with PRN liquid \noxycodone. \n\n# Depression: Patient was on bupropion 150 mg BID, duloxetine 40 \nmg QD prior to admission, held in the setting of altered mental \nstatus. She was discharged off these medications, they may be \nrestarted after discharge upon discretion of neurology/PCP. \nBupropion should not be restarted. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n====================\n[ ] Continue ceftazidime (___)\n[ ] F/u with neurology to monitor seizures as outpatient\n[ ] Provide passy-muir valve once secretions decrease\n[ ] F/u with nutrition to monitor tube feeds \n[ ] Consider restarting home pain medications (such as \ngabapentin) and home psychiatric medications (duloxetine) at \ndiscretion of outpatient neurologist/PCP\n\nNEW MEDICATIONS\n___ 2 g IV BID \nLacosamide 200 mg BID \nKeppra 1500 mg BID\nLansoprazole 30 mg PO BID\nMidodrine 10 mg PO TID \nMultivitamin w/ mineral liquid \nNiacin 100 mg PO QID \nZinc sulfate 220 mg PO QD \n\nCHANGED MEDICATIONS\nSeroquel 75 mg QHS changed to 25 mg QHS\n\nHELD MEDICATIONS\nGabapentin 300 mg PO TID\nMethadone 20 mg PO TID\nDoxepin 100 mg PO QHS\nPantoprazole 40 mg PO BID\nBupropion SR 150 mg BID\nDuloxetine 40 mg PO QD \n\nCODE STATUS: Full\nContact: ___ (daughter) ___ \n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Lacosamide level was 10.9 at time of discharge.\n[ ] Bupropion was discontinued during admission given concern \nfor seizures.\n\nACUTE ISSUES:\n=============\n# Acute on Chronic abdominal pain:\n# nausea:\nPt has chronic ___ mid abd pain at baseline, with ___ \nRUQ/epigastric abd pain on admission. Reassuringly, chemistries, \nLFTs and CBC are wnl, Lactate:1.3 and trop X 1 undetectable. CT \nA&P also showed no acute intra-abdominal process to explain the \npatient's symptoms. In fact, there is little to no residual \nfluid component of a left RP collection, measuring 1.7 x 1.0 cm, \n(likely representing evolving hematoma) and the left iliacus \ncollection is no longer visualized. There was mild intrahepatic \nbiliary ductal dilatation and dilation of the CBD (unchanged \nfrom prior), however she is s/p cholecystectomy and LFTs without \nany abnormalities. Multi-factoral pain possible from prior \ngastritis, secondary gastroparesis from prior abdominal \nsurgeries, narcotic bowel syndrome, and distorted GI anatomy. \nViral gastroenteritis less likely etiology of abd pain and \nnausea. Functional abdominal pain is also possible, but dx of \nexclusion and timing is atypical. Most likely dx is exacerbation \nof prior gastritis given location, prior hx of gastritis given \nEGD findings, and relationship to eating/taking pills with \nalmost instantaneous precipitation. She was thus escalated to PO \nBID PPI in addition to initiation of sucralfate. Maintained on \npromethazine for nausea given Compazine allergy. She was \nmaintained on standing bowel regimen. Over few days this \ncombination provided relief from instant pain/nausea following \nconsumption and ultimately allowed successful advancement of \ndiet. Remained on Methadone 10 TID per PCP, ___, and \ndaily EKGs for QTc monitoring.\n\n# Seizure disorder\nShe experienced generalized body shaking on ___ concerning for \ngeneralized tonic clonic seizure. She received IV Ativan 1mg x3 \nfor what appeared to be at least 2 separate episodes \napproximately 10 minutes apart. Etiology may be medication \nrelated, infectious from UTI though\nless likely, subtherapeutic on AEDs given questionable adherence\nat home per family, poor diet. Toxic metabolic and ischemic \ncauses were less likely to be the culprit. Also noted to use \neCigarettes per family, which can also be seizurogenic. Her \nciprofloxacin was discontinued as this can lower seizure \nthreshold. Neurology was consulted and EEG was placed to monitor \nfor seizure activity. She did not have any further seizures and \nwas only noted to have bursts of theta slowing, which are \nnonspecific, and will always be present on her EEG per \nneurology. Her wellbutrin was held on admission and was \ndiscontinued on discharge as this can also lower the seizure \nthreshold. Her lacosamide and keppra levels were drawn and \npending at the time of discharge.\n\n# UA abnormalities:\nUnknown if possible explanation of her abdominal pain (it would \nbe atypical), and certainly much less likely than gastritis as \nunderlying etiology. UA w/ WBCs w/out nitrites but w/ bacteria. \nNo documented fevers but urinary symptoms suggestive of UTI. Has \nhad recent h/o fluorquinolone sensitive Pseudomonas UTI. Had \nvery resistant E coli UTI in ___ ___ to ___, zosyn, tobra). \nReceived cipro in ED. UCx returned mixed flora. She was \ninitiated on ciprofloxacin, which was discontinued on ___ in the \nsetting of generalized body shaking concerning for generalized \ntonic clonic seizure as this medicine can lower the seizure \nthreshold.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n===============\n# mood d/o\nContinued duloxetine and discontinued buproprion per above\n\n# prior DVT/PE currently on apixaban\nContinued apixaban\n\n# leg pain\nContinued gabapentin \n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

F with a PMHx notable for gastric \nbypass (c/b SBO), esophagitis/gastritis, PUD/HCV, \ncholecystectomy, nephrolithiasis, and CVA (___) who presented \nto ___ on ___ with a week of nausea, abdominal discomfort, \nand vomiting x2 days. Of note, she had been previously evaluated \nby GI in ___ for the same presenting symptoms.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES:  \n====================  \n# Abdominal Pain\n# Gastritis\n# Esophagitis\nThe patient presented with weakness and lethargy in the setting \nof nausea and vomiting with poor PO intake. Of note, EGD ___: \nc/w esophagitis, gastritis. She was recently seen by GI in \n___ as a consult while admitted for identical symptoms. \nRecommendations at that time were to treat supportively with PPI \nBID and anti-emetics. Given her history of SBO, a CT A/P was \nperformed on ___ which demonstrated no bowel obstruction. Of \nnote despite recommendations to be discharged on BID PPI, her \ndaughter endorses that she has only been taking omeprazole 20mg \nonce daily at home (unclear how discrepancy arose). We treated \nher supportively with increased dose of PPI 40mg BID, \nsucralfate, and anti-emetics. She remained afebrile, without \ndiarrhea for the entire hospital stay and decreased frequency of \nnausea.\n\n#Prolonged QTc Interval:\n#Chronic Pain requiring methadone:\nPatient on home regimen of Methadone 10mg TID. Her QTc on \narrival to the ED ___ was 412. She received Zofran to treat her \nnausea. Repeat EKG on ___ was 527. A trial of Ativan was used to \ntreat her nausea which was effective, but there was concern of \ncontinued use given her concurrent use of other sedating \nmedications and a significant episode of transient confusion. \nAfter trialing Zofran again for her nausea her QTc returned to \n525. No further anti-emetics with QTc prolong effects were \ngiven. QTc on day of discharge was 420. We attempted to wean \nmethadone while inpatient however patient was unwilling to do so \ntherefore she was discharged on prior regimen.\n\n#Hypomagnesemia:\nPatient admitted with Mg2+ of 1.4. Her magnesium remained low \ndespite multiple attempts at IV repletion. She ranged from \n1.4-1.9 during her admission. This was of significant concern \ngiven the above issue of her prolonged QTc interval. She was \ndischarged on Magnesium Oxide 400 mg PO BID. Mg2+ on discharge \nwas 1.9.\n\n#Hypoglycemia \nDuring the early part of the admission, patient had glucose \nlevels from 49 - 74. This is likely due to minimal PO intake in \nthe setting of abdominal discomfort and nausea. As her nausea \nimproved and she was able tolerate po intake, nutrition was \nconsulted and recommended additional supplementation with \ncarnation instant breakfast at each meal. TSH and AM cortisol \nunremarkable. Her morning glucose on day of discharge was 87. If \nshe is persistently having issues with hypoglycemia in the \nfuture would consider endocrine referral.\n\n#Altered mental status\nThe patient had an episode of confusion and short term memory \nloss on morning of ___. She was awake, alert, and interactive. \nHowever, she was AOx1. Additionally, throughout her admission, \nthe patient had intermittent episodes of drowsiness and \nlethargy. We spoke to her daughter who says these episodes have \noccurred almost every day since she suffered her CVA. Given that \nthis is a long-standing issue we planned for continued follow-up \nwith neurology as an outpatient. This may be the presentation of \nsubclinical seizure activity, but there is also concern for \npolypharmacy. She was awake, alert, interactive, and AOx3 on \ndischarge. \n\n#Severe Hypoalbuminemia:\n#Malnutrition:\nSignificant weight loss, nearly 20lbs. Poor PO intake secondary \nto abdominal pain. Albumin as low as 1.8. Seen by nutrition. \nStarted on carnation supplementation and increased her zinc \ndose. Maintained on thiamine and folic acid. \n\n#Gait instability:\n___ evaluation reveals: Impairments of Body Functions and \nStructures, Activity Limitations and Participation Restrictions \n- Knowledge deficit RE: fall risk\n- Impaired cognition\n- Impaired functional mobility \n- Impaired balance\n- Impaired strength \nPatient is being discharged to SNF for further rehabilitation. \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n===============\n#Hx of CVA despite xarelto\nThought initially to be embolic phenomenon.  Was seen ___ by \nhematology for ongoing anticoagulation with apixaban. \nRecommended follow up with neurology already scheduled.  No \nevidence of acute CVA symptoms at this time.\nRx:\n-Continued Atorvastatin\n-Continued Apixaban\n\n#CHRONIC PAIN\n-Continued Methadone 10 TID\n-Continued Gabapentin\n\n#CHRONIC ANEMIA\nAdmission Hgb of 8.3; discharge Hgb 10.1 near her baseline. \n-Continued home B12 and folate\n-Ferritin (drawn in ___ borderline low at 147.\n\n#Epilepsy\n-Continued Levetiracetam\n-Continued Lacosamide\n\n#Depression/Anxiety\n-Continued Doxepin\n-Continued Auetiapine\n-Continued Duloxetine\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n===================\n- Code status: Full (presumed)\n- Contacts:\n1. ___ - Mother, ___ \n2. ___ - daughter, ___ (* used this contact \nduring hospitalization)\n3. ___ - daughter, ___\n4. ___ - sister, ___ \n- Discharge weight: 71 kg\n\n[] Patient with prolonged QTc (525) during admission and prone \nto hypomagnesemia (1.4-1.9), especially while on omeprazole \ntwice daily.

At that time patient noted to have intermittent \nepisodes of drowsiness and lethargy, which per daughter, occurs \nalmost every day since she suffered her CVA. There was concern \nfor potential polypharmacy with use of methadone and multiple \nsedating medications. Attempt was made to wean methadone while \ninpatient but was not successful. Abdominal pain attributed to \nknown esophagitis/gastritis, and patient was treated with PPI 40 \nmg BID, sucralfate, and anti-emetics. Patient was also noted to \nhave significant weight loss of nearly 20 lbs thought secondary \nto abdominal pain, treated with carnation supplementation and \nmultivitamins. \n\nToday, per ___ house notes, patient \"appearing more \nconfused, repeated words and statement multiple times, \nagitated.\" Note was made of initiation of 20 mg furosemide over \nweekend due to ___ edema.

She shares that she has been having difficulty \nwith short term > long term memory, and that in the past week, \nhas had some trouble with word finding, often having to pause \nmid-sentence to stop and think. She wonders why this is the \ncase.\nShe endorses increased ___ edema over the past several days, \nLLE>RLE, which she says is new (usually symmetric). She notes \nthat at baseline she sleeps on ___ pillows and that she was \ninstructed to do so by her physicians. She has had no chest pain \nor palpitations. \n\nShe notes that she has not been eating well, and attributes this \nto post-prandial abdominal pain; also endorses dysphagia to \nsolids and liquids. She tells me that this AM, she experienced \nshortness of breath while walking to the bathroom (at baseline \nuses walker), and thinks that she is admitted for her dyspnea. \nOverall, she knows that she is not doing well and needs help \nwith\n___, but is reluctant to admit this to herself. She is worried \nabout her daughter, whom recently had brain surgery.\n\nWhen asked about urinary symptoms, she denies any urinary \nfrequency, hesitancy, dysuria. No fevers or chills.\n\nFinally she wonders about why she has yet to receive her home \nmethadone, noting that this is for chronic abdominal pain and \nthat it has been recently weaned to 10 mg TID, which she is \ndoing very well on.\n \nPast Medical History:\n- h/o HTN and DMII, resolved after gastric bypass per patient  \n - s/p cholecystectomy and gastric bypass (___), with f/u  \n complicated by multiple ex lap, gastrectomy, reversal surgery,  \n\n failed J-tube c/b colonic perforation  \n - multiple SBO during f/u from above  \n - hernia repair  \n - chronic abdominal pain, peptic ulcer disease  \n - asthma, stroke (left sided), osteoarthritis, GERD, DVT/PE  \n - narcotic abuse, tobacco abuse  \n - depression, anxiety  \n - muscle weakness / myelopathy, chronic low back pain  \n - vulvar folliculitis  \n - arthorplasty - right total knee  \n - hepatitis C - positive ab test, negative HCV viral load in 2x \n \n tests  \n - nephrolithiasis  \n - thyromegaly - TSH wnl, low free T4  \n\n \nSocial History:\n___\nFamily History:\nMany family members with strokes, HTN, DM.

Note is made of limited visualization of the \nleft peroneal veins. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ y.o. F with PMHx of CVA (___) with residual L \nhemiparesis/hemisensory loss, hx DVT/PE on xarelto, Roux-en-Y \ngastric bypass, prior admission for non-convulsive status \nepilepticus in setting of infection/malnutrition, hx substance\nuse disorder and chronic pain on methadone who presents from ___ \nwith new confusion and report of dyspnea.\n\n# Altered mental status \n# Word finding difficulty\nPatient sent from rehab with report of \"appearing more confused, \nrepeated words and statement multiple times, agitated,\" \nincreasing word finding difficulty, with extra pauses in \nsentences. Initial concern was for CVA vs seizure. CT head \nwithout contrast was not concerning for stroke. Patient had \noutpatient EEG earlier that week which was reassuring. She was \nevaluated by Neurology who felt she was at baseline and \nrecommended against further imaging (MRI, EEG). Patient seemed \nto be mentating appropriately throughout her hospitalization. \nShe was ultimately treated for a UTI but this was felt unlikely \nto cause her AMS. Infectious and metabolic workup was otherwise \nunrevealing (TSH, B12 WNL, RPR nonreactive, blood cultures NGTD, \nno leukocytosis). Doxepin and Seroquel were held due to concern \nfor medication effect / prolonged QTc, patient was reported to \nbe very sleepy at rehab. Doxepin was restarted at discharge, \nSeroquel was held (though patient reported she had not been \nreceiving Seroquel at rehab to begin with). Methadone was also \nheld but restarted. Patient received 2 doses of high-dose IV \nThiamine, though ultimately Wernicke's was felt to be unlikely. \n\n# Dizziness\nPatient reported feeling dizzy upon standing for the past 3 days \nprior to admission, coinciding with starting Lasix for lower \nextremity edema, which was stopped on admission. Patient \ncontinued to report some dizziness with standing. Orthostatic \nvital signs were not positive but patient did not tolerate \nstanding due to dizziness. She was evaluated by ___ who suspected \nsome mild orthostasis (rather than vertigo) and recommended \ncontinuing to work on this at rehab. Neurology was not concerned \nfor BPPV. Compression stockings were placed and encouraged PO \nintake.\n\n# UTI\nPositive UA in ED, which appeared consistent with her priors. \nReceived 1 dose of IV ceftriaxone for UTI, then denied dysuria \nso antibiotics were stopped as she was thought to be colonized. \nThen she reported adamantly that she did have dysuria. Urine \nculture was contaminated, but patient was started on 5d course \nof macrobid for empiric treatment of uncomplicated UTI, to be \ncompleted ___.\n\n# Moderate Protein Calorie Malnutrition \n# Report of Weight Loss\n# Poor Appetite\n# History of gastric bypass\n# Gastritis / Esophagitis\n# Thrush\nPatient reported worsened abdominal pain after eating and \ndysphagia to both solids and liquids. She has had multiple prior \nGI workups, had EGD with esophagitis ___ which could \ncertainly contribute, and thrush on exam for which she was \nstarted on Nystatin. She had a10 lb weight loss 177 -> 165 since \n___, but it appears that her weight has been stable since at \nleast ___, though she reported a 13lb unintentional weight \nloss over the past two months. Nutrition consult was obtained, \nconcerned for moderate malnutrition, recommended appetite \nstimulant versus supplemental nutrition support if after a few \ndays her appetite did not improve. This was briefly discussed \nwith patient who agreed to defer decision to outpatient setting. \nRecommended carnation instant breakfast 4xday. Would recommend \noutpatient GI followup as well as routine screening colonoscopy \n(past due, was due ___. Continued home omeprazole 40 mg BID. \n\n# Dyspnea\nNo evidence of PNA on CXR and SpO2 100% on RA upon arrival to ED \nwithout any intervention, 100% on RA while on floor. Looked \neuvolemic to slightly dry. Last TTE ___ with moderate to \nsevere TR with moderate PA systolic hypertension, presumably \nrelated to history of significant PE. TTE was repeated which \nshowed improvement in the degree of TR (mild) and PA systolic \nhypertension (now mild), EF 57%.\n\n# Prolonged QTc Interval\n# Chronic Pain requiring methadone\nPatient on home regimen of Methadone 10mg TID. Her QTc on \narrival to the ED ___ was 584. Per most recent d/c summary, \nthere was an attempt to wean methadone while inpatient however \npatient was unwilling to do so therefore she was discharged on \nprior regimen. QTc improved on HD1, methadone was restarted. EKG \nwas obtained for QTc monitoring on discharge and was normal \n(though reported to be 485 via automated calculator). \n\n# History of DVT/PE\n# Asymmetric ___ edema\nNoted to have asymmetric ___ edema. + History of DVT/PE ___- \nbilateral popliteal DVTs, posterior tibial veins, bilateral \npulmonary emboli involving nearly all segmental branches and a \npossible pulmonary infarct, currently on apixaban (switched from \nrivaroxaban for better absorption)). LENIS were obtained showing \nno DVT. She remained on home apixaban. \n\n# Transaminitis: Likely lab error (hemolyzed), normalized on \nrepeat. \n# Elevated lactate: 2.7 -> 2.0, resolved without intervention. \n2.7 on admission. ___ also be secondary to hemolyzed labs. \n\n# Goals of care \nWhen asked about code status, patient notes she has thought \nabout this during her last stroke, and had wanted to be DNR/DNI, \nbut was told by her children that would be selfish. Currently \nwants more time to think about this question, but at the very \nleast she is certain that she wouldn't want to rely on machines \nlong term. She is thinking about what minimum quality of life \nwould be acceptable for her; notes that being able to \ncommunicate is important, and she also derives great pleasure in\nfeeding/taking care of her cat. Code status currently Full with \nlimited trial.\n\n===============\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n===============\n# Hx of CVA despite Xarelto\n# L side weakness\nStable neurologic exam with L side weakness and decreased facial \nsensation, mild facial droop. Stroke thought likely embolic, \nalthough no documented afib. Was seen ___ by hematology for \nongoing anticoagulation with apixaban. Per neurology ___ opted \nto continue patient on anticoagulation pending stroke neurology \nfollow up. Continued home atorvastatin. \n\n# Chronic pain\nInitially held home Methadone 10 TID given prolonged QTc, \ncontinued home gabapentin, bowel regimen.\n\n# Chronic anemia\nAdmission Hgb 12.1, suspect hemoconcentration I/s/o dehydration. \n8.8 on discharge, consistent with prior hospitalization. \nContinued home B12 and folate.\n\n# Epilepsy\nContinued home Levetiracetam 1500 mg BID, Lacosamide 200 mg BID\n\n# Depression/Anxiety\nHeld home Doxepin and Seroquel (see above), restarted on \ndischarge.

Therefore embolism from PFO felt unlikely. \nAdditionally LENIs negative for DVT in lower extremities. \nIschemia most likely due to low flow state, although the timing \nrelative to his initial abdominal pain in early ___ and \nthen his lower GI bleeding in later ___ remained \nenigmatic. Hepatology was consulted during this admission and \nfelt ischemic colitis to be the most likely cause, and did not \nfeel the benefit of colonoscopy would outweigh the risk in this \nsetting.

EKG in the \nED showed no ischemic changes, and 3 sets of cardiac enzymes \nwere normal, making acute coronary syndrome unlikely.  Urine tox \nwas negative for cocaine use, also ruling out a syndrome X, or \nacute narrowing of the coronary arteries.  Given the patient's \nlack of compliance with her HTN and GERD medications, her \nepisode likely reflected a hypertensive crisis with possible \noverlying reflux.  Her emphysema may have also contributed to \nher SOB.  \n\nThe patient received a prednisone taper 60 mg, ___, as well \nas albuterol prn, ipratropium nebs, and fluticasone-salmeterol \nfor her emphysema and experienced improvements in her breathing. \n She was restarted on her home nifedipine and was half her home \nvalsartan dose, which subsequently normalized her blood \npressures.  She was also started on her home aspirin 81 mg daily \nand ompeprazole.  A lipid panel was drawn, which was within \nnormal limits, including a LDL of 111.  Giver a ___ risk \nscore of 4%, a statin was not initiated.  At the time of \ndischarge, the patient had been free of chest pressure and SOB \nfor 48 hours. \n\nUrinary retention with baseline ___ weakness/numbness/tingling: \n\nDespite recent initiation of opiods for pain control in the ED \nand on the floor, the patient's new onset of urinary retention \nupon reaching the floor raised concern for cord compression.  L \nspine MR was performed showing no evidence for cord compression, \nspinal stenosis or foramenal narrowing.  The patient's urinary \nretention resolved that evening and recurred the next day with \nconstipation following her morning morphine dose.  Opiods were \ndiscontinued.  With a bowel regimen, the constipation and \nurinary retention resolved, and the patient was discharged on \ntylenol for pain control. \n\nGiven the patient's complaints of of baseline L leg weakness and \nb/l ___ numbness and tingling, B12, TSH, folate levels were drawn \nrule out possible metabolic sources of of peripheral neuropathy. \n An outpatient Neurology appointment was arranged to follow up \nlikely peripheral neuropathy underlying these symptoms.  \n\nA ___ consult was called and cleared the patient for ambulation \nat home, though visiting home services were arranged for the \npatient's chronic pain and anxiety.\n\nHTN: \n\nThe pt was acutely hypertensive on admission (SBP 180-190), and \nresolved on home nifedipine and ___ dose of valsartan with which \nshe was discharged.\n\nRUQ pain / bruising: \n\nLikely related to patient's hepatitis, the patient's LFTs were \nmildly elevated and coag studies wnl.  There were no acute \nissues during her hospital stay.\n\nPVD: \n\nNo issues. A recent Cardiology appointment judged the patient's \nlower extremity symptoms to be unlikely due to her PVD given ABI \nshowing minimal disease below the knees.  As discussed above, \nher ___ weakness, numbness and tingling is ossibly due to \nperipheral neuropathy secondary to alcohol abuse. Outpatient \nneurology appointment was scheduled. \n\nAlcohol abuse:\n\nGiven the patient's history of alcohol abuse, she was placed on \nCIWA protocol but showed no signs of withdrawal throughout her \nstay.\n\nFibromyalgia:\n\nThe patient was given Morphine 15 mg po q12h for pain control \nand then transitioned to tylenol given the patient's new onset \nof urinary retention and constipation.

This \nepisode was possibly due to your gastric reflux as well as \nstrain on the heart due to hypertension.  Your emphysema was \nlikely contributing to your shortness of breath.  In the \nhospital, an electrocardiogram and lab tests showed that you did \nnot have a heart attack.  You were restarted on your home \nnifedipine and half dose of valsartan for your blood pressure \nand omeprazole for your GERD.  Your home aspirin was also \nstarted to help prevent future heart attack.  For your shortness \nof breath, you were given your a short course of oral steroids \nas well as ipratropium and Advair, which helped to relieve your \nsymptoms.  \n.\nDuring your episode of chest pressure, you also sustained 3 \nfalls on your L hip, which increased your L leg pain and \nweakness.  An MR scan of your lumbar spine showed no evidence of \nspinal cord or nerve root compression that might exacerbate your \nsymptoms.  In the hospital, your pain was well-controlled on \noral morphine.  This medication caused you to have urinary \nretention and constipation.  You should not take this medication \nin the future.  \n.\nYou were instructed to follow-up with an outpatient Neurologist \nfor further management of your lower extremity symptoms, which \nmay be due to peripheral neuropathy.      \n.\nOn ___, you were discharged without further episodes of chest \npressure and with your shortness of breath and hypertension \nunder control.  You were scheduled to follow-up with your \nprimary care doctor.  \n.\nIt is important to take your medications on a regular basis to \nprevent symptoms from your hypertension, acid reflux and most \nimportantly, strain on your heart.  Please discuss with your \nprimary care strategies that might make it easier for you to \ncontinue to take these medications.\n\nPlease note the following changes to your medications:\n1) TAKE one 10 mg dose of prednisone on the day after discharge\n2) DECREASE Valsartan to 160mg daily \n3) STOP Citalopram and Seroquel until you see Dr. ___ as an \noutpatient\n4) TAKE tylenol for pain, maximum 2 grams a day or 8 extra \nstrength tabs\nContinue the rest of your medications as prescribed at home    \n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"

Pt states pain started around R \nneck and radiates to R arm, R shoulder blade, and R chest wall. \nPain is worse with breathing and is associated with SOB. Also \nhas had a cough for one week, productive of white and yellow \nlittle sputum and plugs.  \nR sided weakness/tremor progressive over years. Her mobility has \nbeen more limited, and she can't walk far w/out help.

She also has \nseasonal allergies, and there has been a large deal of \nconstruction outside of her apartment building, with a good \namount of fine dust (changing bricks). She has kept her windows \nopen despite this for fresh, cool air.  \nIn the ED, initial VS were: 97.2 96 152/112 22 100% RA  \nOn exam, weak in RUE, RLE with decreased sensation. Wheezes. \nPain to palpation in R shoulder. She received solumedrol, \nazithromycin and duonebs in the ED. Received tylenol and \nmorphine x2 for pain. CXR was unrevealing.

After receiving steroids, nebs and \nazithromycin in the ED, she states that her symptoms \nsubstantially improved. Pt has had no fevers, leukocytosis, or \nx-ray findings of consolidation, thus PNA is highly unlikely. Pt \nhas been ruled out for MI w/ two negative EKGs and troponin \nmarkers. Given patient's chest pain we also ruled her out for PE \nwith a negative CTA which did show severe emphysema. We gave \nprednisone burst x 5 days, albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers, \nand azithromycin. Smoking cessation counseling was provided but \npatient states she is not ready to quit and that she has already \nsignificantly cut down her smoking from 3 packs to about half a \npack per day. We advise pt to use air filter at home and keep \nwindows closed to limit environmental allergens. We continue \nhome spiriva inhaler and was able to arrange for patient to get \na home nebulizer unit for at home albuterol nebulizer treatments \nwhich the patient felt worked better than the MDI. On discharge \npatient was still short of breath given her severe COPD but her \nbreathing was back at baseline.\n  \n# RUE pain and weakness: Pt presented with pain and weakness in \nher right arm and hand which she states has been present for a \nlong time although it was now more painful. This increased pain \nwas likely related to cough and dyspnea, as patient pointed out \nsince when she coughs her right arm and shoulder shake when she \nviolently coughs. Pt does have chronic tremor and chronic R \nsided pain/weakness, which may be from cervical spinal \ndysfunction or peripheral nervous issues. An x-ray of her \nshoulder was negative for fracture or dislocation.\n \n# Fall: Pt had a recent mechanical fall at home, likely \nsecondary to neuropathy. ___ and OT were consulted which she \ndemonstrates decreased strength, decreased ROM, decreased \nsensation, decreased safety awareness, and decreased functional \nmobility affecting her ability to perform ADLs independently so \nit was recommended that patient have home OT and ___ \nrehabilitation. \n\nChronic Issues:\n\n# Hypertension: Pt was generally normotensive throughout \nadmission so we continue home HCTZ, Valsartan, and nifedipine.  \n\n# Depression: Stable without signs of worsening depression so we \ncontinued home Amitriptyline.\n  \n# GERD: Asymptomatic so we continued pantoprazole BID  \n\n# Iron deficiency anemia: At baseline, if not a bit better so we \ncontinued home Ferrous Sulfate.  \n\nTransitional Issues:\n1. Pt will need continued encouragement for smoking cessation. \nShe has severe COPD and should stop smoking immediately.\n2. Pt had elevated lactate level which is likely from her COPD \nwith no other evidence of end organ ischemia. This may need to \nbe followed up if there is concern for other etiologies other \nthan COPD.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nPreadmission medications listed are correct and complete.  \nInformation was obtained from PatientwebOMR.\n1.

AST, ALT, and Alk Phos trended down slightly \nduring her stay. Tbili remained normal throughout her stay. \nPatient was counseled about the importance of stopping alcohol \nas well as cocaine use.\n\n#Alcoholic/HCV cirrhosis: ___ liver biospy showed stage ___ \nfibrosis, however ascites on exam suggests cirrhosis. CT abd/pel \nw/o contrast showed new ascites, no acute liver changes. RUQ \nultrasound showed cirrhosis of the liver but no PVT. Given \npatient's known HCV and heavy ETOH use, the progression to \ncirrhosis is not surprising. MELD score 11. Repeat EGD \n___ showed erythema and mosaic appearance in the whole \nstomach compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy. No \nevidence of esophageal varices. Nodularity and erythema in the \nduodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis. Continued \npantoprazole. INR on admission was 1.3 and remained between \n1.3-1.5 during her stay.

AFP \ncan be elevated in several types of malignancy, including HCC. \nAlthough no concerning liver lesion was identified on RUQ \nultrasound ___, patient should follow-up with a \nhepatologist as an outpatient to continue monitoring for the \ndevelopment of malignancy.  \n\n#ETOH use: Patient has history of EtOH use, told the ED she \ndrank daily but on the floor stated she drank two 24oz beer cans \ntwo times a week. Patient was monitored on CIWA due to concern \nof possible alcohol withdrawal. Social work consulted, offered \nsupport and information on substance abuse cessation. Patient \nwas started on thiamine, B12, folate, and multivitamins. \n\n#Macrocytosis: CBC showed marocytosis likely related to her \nliver disease. Nutrition consult obtained and patient started on \nthiamine, B12, folate, and multivitamins given her history of \nalcohol use. \n\n#Hypoalbunemia: Albumin on admission was low 3.4, likely due to \nher liver disease as well as poor nutrition. Nutrition consult \nobtained. \n\n#COPD: Current presentation of SOB partly due to having run out \nof the inhalers she takes on a daily basis for her COPD. \nRestarted inhalers with good improvement in respiratory \nfunction. \n\n#PVD: Continued ASA 81mg qD.\n\n#HTN: Continued valsartan.\n\n#GERD: Continued pantoprazole. \n\nTransitional Issues\n(1) Patient has appointment to follow-up with hepatologist as \noutpatient. \n(2) Elevated AFP will need to be ___ need periodic \nRUQ U/S to assess for malignancy. \n(3) Please check electrolytes at PCP appt after discharge in the \nsetting of being sent home on lasix/aldactone.\n(4) Consider continuing diuresis in the setting of her ascites \n(5) The patient was sent home with 7 tramadolol pills to help \nwith her abdominal pain. \n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

As you know, you were \nadmitted to the hospital because you were having abdominal \ndiscomfort and shortness of breath. We performed blood tests \nwhich showed that your liver was injured, likely as a result of \nyou drinking alcohol on top of having Hepatitis C.\n\nAn ultrasound showed that your liver has become scarred, which \ncan represent a condition known as cirrhosis. \n\nBecause of your liver not working well, fluid accumulated in \nyour belly and made you feel uncomfortable. We removed some of \nthe fluid from your belly to alleviate your belly pain. We also \ntested the fluid to make sure it was not infected and it was \nnot. People who have cirrhosis sometimes develop varices \n(distended veins) in their esophagus which can bleed \nsignificantly. We performed an upper endoscopy and did not see \nany varices in you. In order to prevent even more damage to your \nliver, it is very important that you stop drinking alcohol and \nstop using cocaine.\n\nIn order to decrease the chance of fluid reaccumulating in your \nbelly, we started you on two new medications (lasix and \naldactone). You will need to go on a low salt diet as was \nexplained to you by the dietician. \n\nWe have made an appointment for you to follow-up with Dr. ___ \n___ ___. We have also made an \nappointment for you to see a liver doctor (___) on \n___ for further management of your likely liver \ncirrhosis and hepatitis C.\n \nThe shortness of breath you were experiencing when you came into \nthe hospital was probably due to a combination of the belly \nfluid as well as you not being able to take the inhalers for \nyour COPD. After we removed some of the belly fluid and gave you \nyour inhalers, your breathing improved. It is important that you \nfollow-up with your primary care doctor to ensure that you \nmaintain a constant supply of your medications.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"

Moderate volume ascites, decreased compared to ___. \n2.  The largest pocket is currently located in the midline \npelvis, just below the umbilicus.  A slightly smaller pocket of \nfluid also seen in the right lower quadrant. \n\n___ CT A/P\n1. Enteric contrast is seen diffusely throughout the loops of \nsmall bowel \nwithout evidence of extraluminal contrast extravasation.  There \nis no free \nair. \n2. Cirrhosis with moderate to large volume ascites. \n3. Ill-defined hypodensity within the spleen is incompletely \ncharacterized on the current study, similar in appearance to the \nprior study and likely an infarct. \n\n___ KUB\nNo free intraperitoneal air.  No radiographic evidence of bowel \nobstruction or ileus. \n\n___ US Paracentesis\n1. Technically successful ultrasound guided therapeutic \nparacentesis. \n2. 3.4 L of fluid were removed. \n\n___ ABI\n1.  Mild right lower extremity (SFA) and tibia arterial \ninsufficiency at rest. \n2.  Moderate aorto-left iliac and left tibial arterial \ninsufficiency at rest. \n\n___ Hip XR\nMild degenerative changes in the bilateral hip joints. \n\n___ MRI Thoracic/Lumbar\n1. There is no high-grade spinal canal or neural foraminal \nnarrowing of the thoracic or lumbar spine.  No compression of \nthe cord or cauda equina. \n2. Degenerative changes are most prominent at L5-S1 where a \nright eccentric disc bulge crowds the right greater than left \nsubarticular zone contacting but not posteriorly displacing the \ntraversing right S1 nerve root. \n3. There is 9 mm long segment of T2 hyperintense central cord \nsignal at the T1 level on sagittal sequences, not seen on prior \nexaminations and not confirmed on motion degraded axial \nsequences.  This could represent syringohydromyelia or prominent \ncentral canal of uncertain clinical significance.  This could be \nfurther evaluated with contrast enhanced study. \n4. Additional findings described above including sequela of \nknown cirrhosis. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is a ___ year-old lady with HCV/EtOH cirrhosis \nwho presented with abdominal pain after elective paracentesis, \ndeveloped transient urinary retention, and continued to have \nchronic pain.\n\n# Decompensated HCV/EtOH Cirrhosis\n# Hepatic encephalopathy\nKnown history of grade 1 varices, ascites and hepatic \nencephalopathy. No h/o SBP or GIB. Sent from Liver clinic to ED \nafter c/o abdominal pain 1 week after therapeutic paracentesis. \nMild asterixis and volume overload noted. Flu negative. Reported \nlast alcohol 1 month ago. Liver U/S with patent vasculature. \nDiagnostic bedside paracentesis performed, negative for SBP. \nContinued on rifaximin, lactulose. Therapeutic paracentesis \nperformed with 3L removed. Given albumin 25g x1, then 50g x2. \nAttempted repeat paracentesis, but insufficient fluid to \nsuccessfully drain. Held home furosemide/spironolactone.\n\n# Abdominal Pain\n# Chronic Pain\n# Polysubstance misuse disorder\nHistory of chronic pain. On tramadol, pregabalin, and APAP at \nhome. Last underwent paracentesis ___ and complained of \nabdominal pain afterwards. Multiple similar admission. Over the \ncourse of the admission, with further discussion it seems the \npain is severe, but longstanding. Notes \"bone pain\" throughout, \nR hip locking, mandible pain, and abdominal pain. Also notes \npain/odd sensation with urination and defection which she \nreports has been present since before the admission. Consulted \ndental and obtained panorex which showed no infection. Consulted \nchronic pain and trialed cyclobenzaprine and baclofen, however \nboth were discontinued due to urinary retention. Continued on \ntramadol, tylenol, pregabalin, and lidocaine patch. At time of \ndischarge, pain at baseline from prior to admission.\n\n# Urinary Retention\nNoted new inability to urinate with high bladder scans. Foley \ncatheter placed after several straight cath attempts. Also \ncomplained of new fecal incontinence to RN and thigh numbness. \nSensation intact on exam and rectal tone present, but obtained \nMRI spine which showed no signs of cord compression. Stopped \ncyclobenzaprine, Dilaudid, loratidine, baclofen. Urology \nconsulted and recommended home w/ foley for ___ days, but then \nshe briefly was able to void on her own. Retention presumed ___ \nmed effect from cyclobenzaprine and/or baclofen but also may be \na component of neurogenic bladder given neuropathy elsewhere. \nRepeat retention on day of discharge. ___ placed to remain in \nwith urology follow-up.\n\n# Acute Kidney Injury\nBaseline Cr 0.7-0.8. Admission Cr 1.1 likely representing \nsignificant decrease in GFR due to patient's size and lack of \nmuscle mass. No hyponatremia or hydronephrosis. Cr peaked at \n1.4, then improved s/p 2 day of 1mg/kg albumin. Held home \nfurosemide.\n\n# T2 Hyperintense Signal\n9mm segment of T2 hyperintensity noted in the central cord at \nthe T1 level on Thoracic MRI, not seen on previous exams and not \nconfirmed on axial sequences. Could be syringohydromyelia or \nprominent central canal; unclear clinical significance. No \nnotable dermatomal sensory or strength deficits. Deferred \nfurther evaluation, which could be done with a contrast-enhanced \nMRI.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES\n==============\n# Severe Protein Malnutrition\nPatient with temporal wasting and sarcopenia on exam with \nreported decreased PO intake. Nutrition consulted. Provided \nsupplements with meals.\n\n# Anemia\nStable, without signs of active bleeding.\n\n# Thrombocytopenia\n# Coagulopathy\nDue to underlying cirrhosis. At baseline.\n\n# h/o HTN\nLosartan and amlodipine held on last admission for soft blood\npressures. BPs not elevated. Held antihypertensives\n\n# COPD\nStable. Continued home inhalers.\n\n# GERD\nContinued home PPI.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n===================\n[ ] Consider MRI T Spine with contrast to evaluate signal \nabnormality of unclear clinical significance noted on MRI.\n[ ] Should follow up with urology given persistent urinary \nretention.\n[ ] Developed acute urinary retention in setting of \ncyclobenzaprine and baclofen use. Should avoid using these \nmedications in the future.\n[ ] If persistent mandibular pain, consider dental appointment \nand adjustment of dentures.\n[ ] Volume overloaded, but unable to perform paracentesis \ninpatient. Likely will need short-interval paracentesis.\n[ ] Held diuretics on discharge due to rising creatinine every \ntime attempted to restart diuretics. Assess at f/u appointment \nand restart if indicated.\n[ ] Discharged with foley in place and urology follow-up for \nretention. Foley placed ___.\n\n#CODE: Full \n#CONTACT: Fiance, ___ (___)\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Her pain has previously had minimal \nimprovement following large volume paracentesis.  She presented \nwith acute on chronic abdominal pain in the setting of a recent \ntraumatic fall resulting in possible rib fracture. CT abd/pelvis \nshowed no PVT and infectious work up was negative, including a \ndiagnostic paracentesis that showed no SBP.  The etiology \nremained unclear, possible due to baseline distention and \numbilical hernias. Her morphine regimen was increased in \nfrequency and her pain slowly improved. She tolerate tube feeds \nthroughout this time. She was discharged on her home morphine \nregimen. \n\n# Decompensated HCV/EtOH Cirrhosis\nShe has a history of HCV/EtOH cirrhosis c/b ascites requiring \nweekly LVP (did not tolerate diuretics), esophageal/rectal \nvaries and HE. Previously deemed to not be a transplant \ncandidate. On admission, found to have MELD-Na 14, Child's Class \nB. Diagnostic paracentesis negative for SBP.

She continued to receive weekly LVP, last \non ___ ___s lactulose and rifaxamin. She will need q6 \nmonth HCC screening. \n\n#Adrenal insufficiency \nGiven persistent hyperkalemia, morning cortisol was checked and \nfound to be ~0.5 x2. Cosyntropin stimulation test then showed an \ninappropriate response concerning for adrenal insufficiency. \nEndocrine was consulted, recommended sending 21-hydroxylase Ab,  \npending at time of discharge, and holding off on imaging. She \nwas discharged on hydrocortisone 10 mg am and 5 mg at 3 pm with \nplan to follow up in the ___ for further \nmanagement, including possible repetition of the cosyntropin \nstimulation test and with aldosterone. \n\n# Odynophagia\nPatient presented with white plaques on tongue and pain with \nswallowing, concern for ___ esophagitis. The symptoms also \ncorresponded to two Dobhoff placements, so mechanical trauma to \nesophagus was also considered. She had only mild improvement \nwith Nystatin/Fluconazole x 14 days. GI was consulted and \nrecommended starting carafate and PPI for possible variceal \nirritation by ___. Overall her symptoms improved/remained \nstable. She should follow up with her PCP and GI as an \noutpatient to consider repeat EGD. \n\n# HCV, Genotype 1a\nHCV VL undetectable earlier in ___.

She was \ntransfused 1 unit on ___ and her Hgb remained stable around \n___. She will need a repeat CBC as an outpatient.  \n\n#Malnutrition \nNoted to have very poor oral intake associated with significant \nweight loss in last month. ___ was placed this admission and \ntube feeds were started per nutrition recs. She should continue \non tube feeds and tolerated her goal rate. Discharged with plan \nto continue them at home. \n\n#Disposition\nPhysical therapy evaluated the patient and recommended rehab. \nThe patient refused and wished to be discharged home. Risks were \nreviewed, including concern for falls and serious harm. She \nunderstood the risks and still wished to go home. She was \nultimately discharged home with home services with plan for \nclose follow up. \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES\n==============\n# Diabetes Mellitus\nPresented with elevated blood glucose values after missing \nseveral doses of insulin. She was placed back on her home \nregimen of glargine, NPH and SSI with good blood glucose \ncontrol.

The cause of this was from rib fractures and from the \nchronic abdominal pain related to your cirrhosis.\n\nYour labs were stable in the hospital, and we continued to treat \nthe symptoms and conditions related to your cirrhosis.\n\nYou developed pain in your throat while hospitalized. We felt \nthis may be related to the feeding tube which was placed to \nprovide extra nutrition. It could also be caused by a fungus \ncalled ___, and we started an anti-fungal medication to \ntreat this. If this pain does not resolve, you may need an \nendoscopy to take a look at the esophagus.\n\nWe discussed your prognosis; unfortunately, with your liver \ndisease, we can treat the symptoms but not the primary cause. As \nsome point you will get an infection or bleed which we cannot \ntreat. We don't think this will be tomorrow or next week, but it \ncould be in a year or less. The palliative care team helped and \nwill continue to help you make the best choices and support you \nin this difficult time.\n\nYou will need a repeat paracentesis on ___. Additionally, \nplease start taking the new medications as described below. \n\nIt was a privilege to care for you in the hospital, and we wish \nyou all the best.\n\nSincerely,\n\nYour ___ Health Team\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"

On \n___ patient noted to have a large bloody stool, management of \nwhich was not within her GOC. The patient was transitioned to \nCMO and passed away surrounded by her friends and family. \n\nACUTE ISSUES:\n=============\n#GI bleed\nPatient noted to have had a large bloody bowel movement on \n___. In discussion with the patient and her HCP, \ninvestigation/treatment of this would require intubation which \nwas not w/in the patient's GOC. With this in mind, in addition \nto her multiple medical issues discussed below and her numerous \nadmissions in the past year, the patient and HCP decided that \ncontinuing aggressive treatment was only prolonging of the \ninevitable and the patient was transitioned to CMO. \n\n#Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure\nOn ___, patient was found struggling to breath. O2 sat was 82% \non 2L and tachypneic in ___. SBP started to rise peaking up to \n220s and HR was in the 140s. She was given lasix 80mg, and \nplaced on non-rebreather mask following which O2 sat increased \nto mid-90s. However, she continued to be tachypneic in ___ with \nSBP>200. Stat CXR and clinical assessment suggested flash \npulmonary edema vs. ARDS ___ to infection which was c/b \ndecompensated cirrhosis. She is DNI/DNR though respiratory code \nwas called and she was placed on BiPAP. She was transferred to \nICU for BiPAP management, nitro drip for HTN management, and \nvolume control. She was transitioned to CMO when transferred \nback to the floor when her family, the patient, and HCP decided \nthat her GOC did not include continued respiratory support. It \nwas felt that she would not recover from her sepsis, GI \nbleeding, and pulmonary edema.\n\n# HYPOTENSION, likely due:  \n# SEPSIS:  \n# ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY:  \nHypotension likely multifactorial including sepsis given fever, \nbandemia, GPC bacteremia, and peritonitis. CXR on admission with \ninfiltrate concerning for possible HAP. Diagnostic para was \nconsistent with SBP. She was started with \nvanc/cefepime/metronidazole ___ transition). Additionally, \npatient has known adrenal insufficiency and she was started on \nstress dose steroids hydrocortisone 50mg Q8hrs which was \ndiscontinued on transition to CMO.\n\n# GPC BLOODSTREAM INFECTION:  \nPatient with GPCs in cluster and pairs. Regarding sources, there \nwas concern for enterococcal source from GI. Additionally \npatient with risks for MRSA including many recent \nhospitalizations. She was continued on Vancomycin, and ID was \nconsulted. However, she was transferred to ICU before speciation \nwas determined. When transferred back to the floor, ID was \nconsulted and felt that this organism was a contaminant. \n\n#Severe Ascites\n#HCV/EtOH Cirrhosis: \nChild's Class B on admission. Previously decompensated by \nascites (did not tolerate diuretics), esophageal varices, and \nHE. Diagnostic para in ED positive for SBP, though she had had \nmultiple recent paras that were negative for SBP. \n\n# PERITONITIS - SPONTANEOUS vs. SECONDARY:  \nConcomitant GPC bacteremia and significant abdominal pain raised \nsome concern for secondary peritonitis. However, ___ \ncriteria suggested otherwise (ascitic protein<1.0, glucose>50; \nLDH not checked). Studies concerning for SBP however. Given \nabove discussion of other potential sources, she was started on \nCefepime. \n\n# ACUTE ON CHRONIC ANEMIA:  \n# ACUTE ON CHRONIC THROMBOCYTOPENIA:  \n# COAGULOPATHY:  \nNo visible bleeding and patient's hemoglobin baseline is likely \nclose to 7.7. Presented with 9.9 iso poor PO intake which likely \nrepresented some degree of DDx includes marrow suppression and \nworsening liver function in setting of sepsis.\nAnemia was concerning for possible bleeding; though no clear \nevidence on exam but has known esophageal and rectal varices. \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n===============\n# Adrenal Insufficiency: \nDiagnosed during recent hospitalization. She was previously on \nHydrocortisone 10 and 5mg BID. On admission however, given acute \nhypotension and underlying sepsis she was started on stress dose \nsteroids.\n\n# Chronic Abdominal Pain: \nShe was started with home PO Morphine Liquid ___ mg Q2-4H PRN \nspaced to Q6 given respiratory depression and hypotension as \nwell as home tizanidine was held\n\n# Diabetes Mellitus: \nBG 100-200s.

There is no pericardial effusion. \nIMPRESSION: Normal regional and global biventricular systolic \nfunction. There is a small echodensity seen on the tricuspid \nvalve - see images 52-56. This could represent a vegetation or \nthickened valve/chord. A TEE could be done to help clarify. No \nabscess seen. No significant valvular regurgitation seen. \n\n___ CTA Chest: IMPRESSION: 1.  Calcification within the right \nposterior basal segmental pulmonary artery with occlusion of the \nartery distally - these features are suggestive of chronic \npulmonary embolism.  No acute PE is identified.  2.  Necrotizing \npneumonia involving the right lower lobe with surrounding \nabscess formation.  The appearances are similar to the previous \nCT.   3.  Multiple nodular opacities within the right middle, \ninferior segment of the left upper and the basal segments of \nleft lower lobes.  In conjunction with the clinical history, \nthese features are suggestive of septic emboli.  4.  Mediastinal \nand right hilar adenopathy which is likely reactive.   \n\n___ Cardiac Echo (TEE): No spontaneous echo contrast or \nthrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial \nappendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial \nappendage. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is \nseen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. \nLeft ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). \nRight ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. \nThe ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are \nnormal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque to 34 cm \nfrom the incisors. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear \nstructurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There are three \naortic valve leaflets. No masses or vegetations are seen on the \naortic valve. There are filamentous strands on the aortic \nleaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal variant). \nNo aortic valve abscess is seen. No aortic regurgitation is \nseen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mass \nor vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. No mitral \nregurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened. There is no pericardial effusion. \nIMPRESSION: No 2D echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis. No \nsignificant valvular regurgitation.\n\n___ Renal U/S: IMPRESSION:  Echogenic kidneys consistent with \nmedical renal disease.  No vascular abnormality seen. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ year old male with PMH presumed MSSA tricuspid valve \nendocarditis and PE presenting with right lung abscess and \npossible necrosis.\n\nActive issues: \n___: Patient noted to have elevation of his Cr to 2.6 on ___ \nwhich peaked at 2.8 on ___. Baseline Cr is 0.6-0.7. This is of \nunclear etiology. Patient had no episodes of hypotension, urine \nmicroscopy was unremarkable (few granular casts, no other \nfindings) and renal U/S was unrevealing (no evidence for \nthrombus/emboli).  Pt was clinically euvolemic and no \nimprovement with IVF. Possibly related to contrast though timing \nnot perfect. At time of discharge, Cr was downtrending to 2.4.\n\n# Lung abscess: History of recent PE on coumadin with symptoms \nand imaging consistent with likely lung abscess. He had a CT \nscan that showed a right lung abscess with air fluid level. He \nwas placed on vanco and zosyn and ID was consulted. They \nrecommended ___ weeks of IV antibiotics. CT surgery was also \nconsulted who ultimately felt that surgery was not appropriate \nin the acute setting. It appears that the abscess is draining \nthrough his airway at this time. Thoracics will see the patient \nas an outpt to evaluate for possible surgical options after \n___ of antibiotics. Patient should obtain repeat CT Chest \nscan prior to stopping antibiotics. In the setting of his ___ \n(see above), pt's Zosyn dose was reduced to 2.25g q8 hrs from \n4.5g q8hrs and his Vancomycin was reduced to 1000mg q48 hours \nfrom 1250mg IVq8hrs. As his kidney function improves, his \nantibiotic dosing will need adjustments. \n\n# Hemoptysis: Likely ___ PE and lung abscess complicated by \nsupratherapeutic INR which was improving by time of admission to \nthe MICU with FFP and vitamin K. He never had any evidence of \nactive bleeding and was felt to be stable for the floor.\n\n# Septic pulmonary emboli: Right-sided PEs noted on imaging and \npatient being treated with coumadin on admission. Patient taking \nKeflex since the diagnosis of PE was made. The OSH felt the PE \ncould be septic emboli so he was being treated with Keflex \nprophylactically. Given the above hemoptysis his anticoagulation \nwas held during his MICU course. In further review of OSH \nrecords (including LENIs which showed no DVTs) and conversation \nwith ID and ICU team, it was felt that these all represent \nseptic emboli and not thrombotic disease. As a result, pt was \nkept off anticoagulation and discharged without warfarin or \nalternative blood thinner.  \n\n# Endocarditis: Recent history of TV endocarditis that was \ntreated with 6 weeks of IV nafcillin. Patient did not have any \nsigns on admission, but blood cultures were drawn and came back \nnegative. He had a cardiac echo that showed possibly a small \nvegetation on his TV; however, TEE revealed no vegetations and \nhe was felt to have cleared any evidence of active endocarditis. \n\n\nChronic issues: \n# Anemia: Unclear if chronic or acute. Given the illness over \nthe last several months, likely chronic related to inflammation. \nHowever, given the hemoptysis could also be related to blood \nloss.  Iron studies were checked and were not abnormal. Over the \ncourse of his hospitalization his blood counts remained stable. \nHe was started back on his home iron supplement on discharge.\n\n# IVDA: Complicated social situation with long hx of drug abuse \nand recent withdrawal from stopping methadone. Patient's mother \ninvolved and concerned about addiction problems.  He was seen by \nsocial work, but the patient declined to speak with them. \nAttempts were made to limit narcotics and benzos after his \nmother reported that she felt that he was abusing them more than \nhe should on prior admissions. He was continued on his home \noxycodone and xanax with good effect. He did not ask for \nadditional medications during the course of his hospitalization. \n\n\n# Depression: He was continued on his home citalopram, \nalprazolam and mirtazapine.\n\nTransitional Issues:\n# Emergency contact: Patient, Mother ___ ___ \n \n# Code: Full  \n# Patient would benefit from Hepatitis B booster vaccination as \nHep B surface antibody was low (only borderline positive). \n# Patient will need to complete ___ weeks of IV antibiotics. \nExact course to be determined by infectious disease.\n# Needs at least weekly lab draw while on antibiotics: Vanco \ntrough, CBC, BUN/Cr, LFTs\n# Continued social support regarding sobriety \n# Should NOT be discharged to home with a PICC line in place\n# Patient should have repeat CT Chest in ___ weeks prior to \ndiscontinuing antibiotics\n# Will follow-up with thoracic surgery as may need surgical \nintervention to fully eradicate infection\n# Will need close monitoring of kidney function and Vanco \ntroughs in the next week to appropriately adjust his antibiotics \nand ensure appropriate coverage given the serious nature of the \ninfection and his rapidly changed kidney function. \n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

You were admitted \nbecause you were coughing up blood. A CT scan of your chest \nrevealed a large abscess (fluid collection) that is due to \nbacteria traveling from your heart valve infection to your \nlungs. We started you on strong, broad antibiotics and you were \nseen by the pulmonology team (the lung doctors), the infectious \ndisease doctors and the thoracic surgeons. Your symptoms \nimproved with the IV antibiotics but you continue to have cough \nand pain with deep breaths. We also performed ultrasounds of \nyour heart (TTE and TEE) which revealed that the infection on \nyour heart valve has resolved. You will need ___ weeks of \nantibiotics for this serious infection. A repeat CT scan of your \nchest will be arranged prior to the end of your antibiotic \ncourse.\n\nWe also tested you for Hepatitis B during this admission. It \nshowed that you have been immunized (vaccinated) against \nHepatitis B. However, the strength of your immunity is low. You \nwould benefit from booster vaccination as an outpatient. Please \ndiscuss this with your primary care provider. \n\nFinally, there a decrease in your kidney function. We monitored \nyour kidney function and it was improving at time of discharge. \nYour doctors at your ___ facility will continue to monitor your \nkidney function and the level of antibiotics (the vancomycin) in \nthe blood to ensure you are properly treated. \n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"
